"10 -year -old girl with diagnosis of rhinoconjuntivitis and bronchial asthma. He had previously performed two years of sublingual immnotherapy against polenes, which had to be suspended due to poor tolerance (cough and respiratory stridor). Subsequently, new specific subcutaneous immunotherapy cycle began in our hospital, with poor tolerance during induction in the form of sudden cough episodes and laryngeal stridor, maintaining at all times a non -pathological pulmonary auscultation, oxygen saturation and normal vital constants. However, and given the high suspicion of the existence of a psychogenic component involved in the painting, it was decided to administer the following dose under surveillance in our technical area and simple blind and controlled with placebo. After the placebo dose, the patient reproduced the same symptoms, which progressively referred after their corresponding dose of immunotherapy. With this, the psychogenic component was verified as the main responsible for the clinical picture, being able to continue with immunotherapy and also remove all chronic treatment related to its cough.

We exposed the case of a patient who presented immediate and stridor cough as an immunotherapy reaction and who could continue his treatment without incident after objectifying the psychogenic origin of said reaction."

Hemogram and biochemistry: within the parameters of normality.

Chest TC: existence of mediastinal and hiliary adenopathies, in addition to repetition and changing alveolar consolidations, which in the absence of anatomical structural anomalies, are suggestive of immunodeficiency.
In the immune study, normal levels of IgG, IGA and IGM and complement immunoglobulins are objectified. A IgG subclass deficit (IgG3) and absence of response against prot√©ic antigens is evidenced. The immunophenotypic characterization study of circulating lymphocytes is normal, as well as the study of lymphoproliferative capacity against mitogenos.

"Child, 8 years, post operated of acute peritonitis, treated with piperacilin-tazobactam, vancomycin and anti-18th (metamizol and paracetamol) before a septic picture of difficult handling. The quadragesimo day of admission, presents clinical worsening with high fever, edemas, hepato-splenomegaly, lateocervical adenopathies and generalized pruriginous macular cutaneous rash. Analytically highlights hypertransaminasemia and eosinophilic (11.9%). Associates hemophagocytic syndrome (confirmed by bone marrow aspirate), pericarditis and intra -abdominal abscesses. Oriented the picture as Dress syndrome (cutaneous biopsy with spongiotic pattern), is initially suspected of vancomycin as a cause. The same is removed and endovenoso corticosteroid treatment begins improving the picture progressively.

It is subsequently done immunoallergic study, being the total normal IGE. CAP, oral provocation test and negative beta -lactam. Cap to cephalosporins, metamizol and negative vancomycin. Prick to Ceftazidima and Piperacilina-negative tazobactam. At 12pm of the cutaneous test for Metamizol, it presents a generalized maculopapular-eryhathmatose rash, considering metamizol as one of the probable causes of the syndrome presented during admission. No vancomycin test is performed due to its potential risk."
"CASE SCOPE
We present a clinical case about the outpatient management of a patient with heart failure, where specialists in family and community medicine participate, avoiding unnecessary admission to the patient.

Reason for consultation
Decompensated heart failure, dyspnea at rest.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)

Anamnesis: 76 -year -old male. Family history without interest. No known medication allergies. Exfuster with youth in youth and until 13 years ago, 10 cigarettes per day (ICAT 23 packages/year). Dyspnea Grade III/IV MMRC (not valued by pneumology). HTA and DM Type 2 in treatment with oral antidiabetics, with target organ involvement (retinopathy and renal insufficiency Stadium 3 in follow -up by nephrology, last review in August 2019). Chronic disorder anemia. Past hepatitis B virus infection (AC Anticore and positive antihbs). Depressive syndrome.
The patient comes in the last month with greater demand, for worsening his depressive condition, with intense asthenia, which the patient attributes to their depression. However, in a consultation, the patient refers to dyspnea to slight efforts, with clear worsening of their basal dyspnea, in addition to edema with fovea in both lower members from distal third to media and orthopnea of ‚Äã‚Äã3 pillows.

Physical examination: Good general condition, tachypneic at rest, well hydrated and perfused. Normoclloro.
Auscultation: Rhythmic cardiac tones with systolic blows in aortic focus III/IV. Good vesicular murmur with thick bases of media bases
Abdomen: soft and depressible, not masses, not megalias, not painful to palpation, no signs of peritoneal irritation
Lower limbs: edema with fovea to medium third.
Neurological: oriented in the three spheres, preserved superior functions. No neurological focus

Complementary tests:
TA: 145/90 FC: 104 LPM. O2 saturation: 98% a/a
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 72 LPM, left axis, PR without alterations, narrow QRS with left ventricular hypertrophy data. No acute ischemic alterations
RX thorax: well -inspired, with cardiotoral index within the upper limits, without increase in density, with costophyrnic breast pinching and bilateral pleural spill with signs of cardiac congestion
RX control thorax after treatment: well -inspired, with cardiotoral index within the upper limits, without increased density, and preserved costophenic breasts.

Family and community approach
73 -year -old patient, independent for basic activities of daily life, handles money and medication, preserved superior functions and Barthel 75 points, with good family support. High socio-economic level.

Action and Evolution Plan
After the assessment of the exploration, it is decided to perform urgent chest and urgent analytics radiography for the next morning, once it is displayed in pleural effusion, and the results of the analytics with a natural atrial peptide, it is decided to increase the furosemide 40 mg oral via, of 1 tablets to 2 and a half a day, and return to 3 days to the consultation to reevaluate.
After these three days, the patient comes to consultation again, with clear decrease in edema in both lower members. Urgent control radiography is guided. In the radiography we can observe great clinical improvement of the patient, without visualization of pleural effusion, while the dyspnea that the patient presents.
After reassessing the patient, the staggered reduction of the dose of furosemide is explained, explaining the patient, the need for correct adhesion to treatment, in addition to hygienic-dietary measures and weighing every day.
After 10 days of deployment intensive treatment, we quote the patient again, and observe the resolution of the picture completely, with total disappearance of edemas in lower limbs, in addition to good pulmonary auscultation and non -visualization of pleural spill.
Months later, the patient has good control of their chronic pathologies in consultation."
"Reason for consultation
Diplopia and headache after craniocerebral trauma (TCE).

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
This is a 41 -year -old smoker with a history of talaasemia, tension headache, hyperactive bladder without response to anticholinergic, emotional instability disorder of personality and very demanding in consultation, which after suffering a cranioesencephalic trauma in the workplace presents headache associated with diplopia. In his labor mutual they perform skull TC, in which they detect a cranial parsia and report that symptomatology is not related to the accident suffered, which is why they refer it to their family doctor. Neurological exploration is performed without alterations, so it is recommended observation and analgesia. After several consultations and given the persistence of the clinic after a month of evolution, derivation to neurology is decided.

In her first visit to external neurology consultations, the patient refers to also the headaches and diplopia, which persist 2 months after the TCE, decreased visual acuity. In the neurological exploration, limitation of eye movements is not objective, as well as other alterations of cranial pares, strength and sensitivity of members. March and balance are not altered either. They request magnetic resonance (RM) cranial, as well as interconsultation of ophthalmology and pose if the complementary tests are normal.

Diagnostic judgment: Diplopia under study (posttraumatic diplopia, unable to rule out functional origin), chronic headache (tension + medication abuse).

Complementary tests and evolution: Cranial RM is performed in which injuries in supratory white substance appear with periventricular and juxtacortical demyelinizing characteristics that they propose, as the first possibility, multiple sclerosis (EM) with acute activity. Angioresonance of supraaortic trunks without interest findings is also performed. After image test results, the patient is cited again to explain the findings and propose lumbar puncture. The patient persists with headaches, which is associated with generalized asthenia, without other findings of new appearance.

It is also requested analytical with hemogram, biochemistry with renal, hepatic profile, TSH, ECA, vitamin B12 and folic acid that is below the limits of normality, proteinogram, autoimmunity (ANA, ANCA, AC antisolipins/ beta 2 microglobulins, AC Antigalnliaids) without alterations, serologies (HIV, VHC, VHC, VHC, VHC, VHC, LUES) where it stands out non -immunization against HBB. Immunized compared to measles, rubelola, VEB mumps, VHS, VZZ.

It is valued by ophthalmology performed by optical coherence (OCT) with optical nerve involvement of 2 temporary sectors of the right eye and 4 temporal sectors in the left eye. Decrease in macular ganglionic cells in the left eye.
After lumbar puncture is confirmed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of oligoclonal bands, so, together with the findings described in the RM, they reinforce the diagnosis of EM, and the patient is referred to the unity of demyelinizing diseases of our hospital.

Genetic test is requested to rule out caddasil (autosomal cerebral dominant artheriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoenchalopathy) that is negative and new cranial and core rm. The cranial without changes with respect to prior. In the core RM there are small core focal lesions at the level of C3 and C4, which could correspond to demyelination spotlights. It indicates amantadine and it is proposed to start thermiflunomide in March 2020 as a drug modifier drug.
At the time of this last visit the patient is without diplopia, recurring headaches persist. Urology is performed for the incontinence that the patient continues to be presented.

During the diagnostic process, the patient has come to our primary care consultation for renewal of the low, in these consultations it has taken advantage of supporting the patient for the diagnosis and trying to solve doubts that may have arisen after attending other specialists."
"Reason for consultation
The patient's son -in -law calls the health center so that his family doctor goes to his home, since he finds it rare. Two days before, he had come to his primary care doctor's consultation for a dyspnea and fever picture, where he was diagnosed by thorax radiography, acute bronchitis and antibiotic treatment began.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Anamnesis: This is an 84 -year -old woman, denies allergic reactions to medications, hypertensive (which by mutual has left the antihypertensive medication), dysliphemic, FA anticoagulated with acenocumarol. Denies toxic habits. INDEPENDENT ABVD.

Upon arriving at home, the patient is obnubilada, with a low level of consciousness, in addition to deviation from the oral commissure and loss of strength of the left hemicrus. AFEBRIL
It is decided to transfer the patient to hospital emergencies through ambulance with medical assistance and being monitored at all times. Ictus code is activated.
Upon arrival at the hospital, his state has not changed. Although, during physical examination, the patient begins with a fever of 38.8oc.

Physical examination:
- Regular general condition, cutaneous paleness, eupneic at rest. Fever of 38.8oc of Novo. TA 156/94.

Family and community approach
Elderly patient who lives alone, until now was ABVD. Good family support. Medium socioeconomic level.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)

Differential diagnosis:
- ACV. Initially, by the antecedent of HTA without treatment and neurological exploration, the diagnosis was oriented towards a stroke. The appearance of fever and normality in the CT and Angiotac, changed the seems to an infectious disease.
- Bacterial meningoencephalitis. Neurological focus and fever lead to an infectious pathology, which was later confirmed by lumbar puncture and Gram.

High clinical judgment: bacterial meningoencephalitis.

Action and Evolution Plan
The patient is transferred to the internal medicine plant. There, it is monitored and initiates empirical treatment with ceftriaxone+ampicillin+vancomycin+dexamethasone IV and antipyretical treatment.
After the beginning of the treatment, the patient gradually improved her general condition, she is currently healthy and without sequelae of the episode."
"Reason for consultation

It is a 19 -year -old woman, without toxic habits or habitual treatment. Intervened appendicitis in childhood and with a history of infectious mononucleosis in puberty.

Go to primary care consultation for a 10 -day fever of evolution, with morning and evening peaks. It is accompanied by rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, soft deposits without pathological products, facies, skin rashes as well as loss of 5 kilos of weight in a month. It does not present another semiology in anamnesis led by devices and systems. Do not live with animals. He has not made trips or excursions to the field. He has not previously presented similar paintings.

On physical examination, the patient presents good general condition, something asthenic, conscious, oriented and collaborator, well hydrated and perfused, non -mucosa, eupneic skin, hemodynamically stable. TA: 112/70 mmHg. FC: 90 SPM. TA 36.3oc.

In oral cavity there are two subcentimetric oral gaps in the lower lip. On the left cheek there is a plaque with some peripheral infiltration and with a melic crust. On nasal septum, neckline and back, second and third fingers of the left hand and second finger left foot erythematous lesions. Submandibular adenopathies and in lateocervical chains, larger on the right side. In cardiopulmonary auscultation, a systolic breath in aortic and pulmonary focus is auscultated. The vesicular murmur is preserved.

We carried out in the Family Medicine Consultation Clinical Cervical Ultrasound observing lateocervical and submandibular adenopathies, fundamentally hypoecogenic with a tendency to the grouping, bilaterally affecting the yugulocarotic chains, in general subcentric and with preserved fatty hilum, without necrosis. The largest measures 2.5 cm long by 1.1 cm in antero-posterior diameter. In the clinical abdominal ultrasound, liver and spleen are observed with size at the high limit of normality, but considering the height and stature of the patient could be considered increased size. In clinical echocardycopy: left ventricle (VI) hyperdinamic, without identifying rude valve alterations. Size and function of the normal right and right ventricle. Absence of pericardial spill.

Given the progression of the picture and the persistence of the symptoms, the derivation to internal medicine to complete study is consensual with the patient.

They perform negative blood cultures and urocultures. Thorax and abdomen tac with evidence of multiple small subcarinal hypercapter, paratraqueal rights and in gastrohepatic ligament, some of them more bulky but of periportal reactive appearance. Biopsy with thick needle guided by ultrasound of submandibular adenopathy informed as infiltrate foci of histiocyte -looking infiltrate, not necrotizing but with apoptosis images. To rule out Gaucher's disease, the quitotriosidase activity is requested in plasma that is negative (47.2 nmoles/ml/hour; normality range: 4 to 76 nmoles/ml/hour).

Favorable evolution, with progressive reduction in the size of the adenopathies and disappearance of fever after oral treatment for 2 weeks with non -steroid anti -inflammatories, remaining asymptomatic a year later."
"CASE SCOPE
We present a case of Herpes Zoster with affectation the two branches of the facial nerve that evolves torpidly. It is diagnosed and treated for primary care, neurology, otolaryngology, physiotherapy and rehabilitation. We attach images of the case, after the patient's consent.

Reason for consultation
Deviation from the mouth, left hearing loss and sensation acorchening left hemicara.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Anamnesis: 71-year-old man who goes to primary care consultation for vesicle-scalpted lesions grouped in left hemicara (from chin to external auditory duct) of five days of evolution, which associates deviation from the right oral commissure to the right, sensation of left hemicara acorcling, left hearing imparation, alteration of the taste sensitivity and difficulty to close left eye of 48 hours of 48 hours of 48 hours of 48 hours of 48 hours of 48 hours of 48 hours. Start treatment with Valacyclovir 1 gram every 8 hours scheduled in the emergency room. No fever or any other systemic symptomatology. In consultation, clinical trial of left peripheral facial paralysis by Herpes Zoster virus.

Among its personal history we find type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, psoriasis and ischemic heart disease with non -revascularized angor. No adverse medication reactions known. He had never had herptic lesions before.
As usual simvastatin treatment 40 mg, 5mg nevibolol, 100mg acetylsalicylic acid, 850mg metformin, 400mcg tamsulos, alopurinol 100mg, 20mg omeprazole and calcipotriol 50mcg/betrametasone 500mcg skin foam.

In consultation, deflazacort 30mg is guided every 24 hours with descending pattern, eye patches, artificial tears.

After consultation, the patient decides to go to private hospital neurology after 3 days without significant improvement in paralysis and appearance of postherpetic neuralgia. After successive consultations in private hospital, realization of brain magnetic resonance without contrast and neurophysiological study of the facial nerve, clinical judgment concordant with the previously established: Ransay-Hunt syndrome.



Exploration: Good general condition, conscious, oriented and collaborator. Well hydrated and perfused. Normocolored. Eupleic at rest. No signs of meningism. Preserved cortical functions. Coherent language. No aphasia. Isocoric and normorreactive pupils. Preserved extrinsic ocular mobility. No campimetric alterations due to confrontation. Deviation from the oral commissure, mild dysarthria, difficulty closing left eyelids, epiphora, diminution of sensitivity in left hemicara. Erythematics-consideous plates extended from middle line of lip and chin to left external auditory duct.

Complementary tests
** Cerebral NMR without contrast: signs of cerebral aging with cortico-subcortical atrophy and images compatible with small-glass ischemic leukoencephalopathy, possibly secondary to terriosclerosis.
** Neurophysiological study of the facial nerve: study compatible with advanced neuropathy of the left facial nerve with loss of axonal volume and signs of degeneration.
** Analytical: without relevant findings.

Family and community approach
71 -year -old man, independent for all ABVD. With good family support. With private health resources. Retired and in full family contraction phase, mature family.

Plan of action
In the successive consultations, the patient partially improves postherpetic neuralgia, so it is allowed to reduce the scheduled analgesic treatment (paracetamol, metamizol, lidocaine in patches, chlolacepatodipot√°sico, index 200 mg every 8 hours and amitriptyline 25 mg every 24 hours). This does not happen, with peripheral facial paralysis. The patient provides therapy reports made in Private Hospital: Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Acupuncture and facial nerve stimulations. Finally, they propose the possibility of surgical treatment it rejects.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, idiopathic or Bell paralysis, post-otic surgery paralysis, acute otitis, chronic otitis (coltestoma, osteitis), acoustic neurinoma (more rare, studying with progressive paralysis), affectation of the geniculated ganglion in the infection context.

Evolution
It began with clinical trial of herpes zoster facial vs dermatological lesions to be filmed. Throughout the days, the process had a torpid evolution, associating hearing loss and paralysis, needing the valuation of different specialties. The Ramsay-Hunt refractory syndrome being confirmed.
The patient, currently suffers from different post-herpetic sequelae such as peripheral facial paralysis, the decrease in taste sensitivity and left-ears that have improved slightly after multiple treatments."
"Reason for consultation

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Anamnesis: 15 -year -old male, with the following background:
No family history of interest.
No known medication allergies.
No cardiovascular risk factors: no HT, no DM, no DLP.
Not other diseases of interest. No surgical interventions. Do not perform active treatment.

The patient comes accompanied by his mother at the emergency department of the Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez Hospital (Huelva) derived from his health center, referring to presenting orange urine 3-4 days of evolution. He also comments pain in the left hypochondrium in the previous days, not present at the time of the consultation. Asthenia of two weeks of evolution associated with feverish sensation not thermometer in previous days. No urinational symptoms. No diarrhea or constipation. No padded. Refers to an isolated vomit the night before. No fever. No consumption of risk food. It denies consumption of toxic and medications.

Physical examination: Good general condition, conscious, oriented and collaborator. Normohydrate and Normoperfundido. Mild cutaneous-very and conjunctival jaundice. Eupleic at rest.
TA: 135/73
SO2: 99%
TA: 38.2oc
FC: 102 LPM
- ACP: Rhythmic tones at good frequency, without blows, friction or extrathones. MVC without pathological noises.
- Soft, depressible, slightly painful abdomen to palpation in the left hypochondrium, without signs of abdominal defense or peritoneal irritation. Murphy and Blumberg sign. Negative bilateral percussion fist. Hernias, masses or megalias are not palpated. Hydroa√©reos noises present.
- Neurological: Pinla. MOEC. Preserved cranial pairs. Preserved strength and sensitivity. No alterations of the march. No meningeal signs. No signs of neurological focus are observed. Complementary tests
- Abdomen RX: visible psoas lines. Feces and gas in colic frame. Gas in rectal ampoule. NO Suggestive radiological image of hydroa√©reos levels.
- Analytics: 17430 leukocytosis with 73.1% lymphocytosis and monocytosis of 11.9%; Total bilirubin of 3.26 (direct BB 2.52, indirect BB 0.74); LDH of 717; AST 309; ALT 377; In urine, bilirubin and uribilinogen +.

Family and community approach
15 -year -old male, without personal or family history of interest. He lives with his parents in a humble area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Huelva. His mother works in a company as a cleaner and his father is a day laborer. He has no brothers. Good family support. Medium-low socio-cultural level. Due to the absence of clinical situations of interest so far, it does not perform active medical monitoring.

Action and Evolution Plan
Given the previously commented clinical and analytical data, it is decided to expand the analytics requesting FA, PCR, HCV, HBB, HIV, GGT and abdomen ultrasound is requested.
Of the expanded parameters, the only thing to highlight is a GGT of 250. The serology of the requested viruses was negative. In abdomen ultrasound, a mild and homogeneous splenomegaly (135mm) was observed as the only significant finding.
In this context, and analyzing the data obtained in the requested tests, it is important to make a differential diagnosis between several pathological entities.
First, fever data, pain in right hypochondrium, jaundice, leukocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia at the expense of direct bilirubin, could make us suspect a biliary picture, such as a cholecystitis. However, in the context of such a picture of this nature, an image compatible with biliary lithiasis and positive ultrasound murphy and positive ultrasound mutiasis would have been found in ultrasound.
On the other hand, the same analytical findings mentioned previously, added to coluria and GGT increase could guide us to a cloedocolithiasis/cholangitis picture. However, in this context, the logical thing would be to have also found analytical data such as high FA (cholestasis enzyme) and ultrasound imaging of the extrahepatic bile duct or calculation image at the bile duct level.
Finally, and taking into account the physical examination with pain in the left and right hypochondrium, fever, jaundice, leukocytosis with lymphomonocytosis in requested analyzes, together with hyperbilirubinemia and mild splenomegaly without affectation of the bile duct objectified by ultrasound, it is proposed as a more likely diagnosis that of infectious mononucleosis (when they are absent and signs symptoms such as pharyngitis and adenopathies typical of said disease).
Thus, given the clinical, analytical and image tests requested, it is finally decided to expand the heterophilic antibodies in the analytics, which turn out to be positive.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Infectious mononucleosis by Epstein Barr virus atypical presentation.

EMERGENCY ACTION AND EVOLUTION PLAN
During his stay in the Emergency Department, the patient was asymptomatic, accompanied by his mother at all times and without presenting adverse events of interest. It was discharged with home treatment of Paracetamol 650mg every 8 hours if fever and relative rest for at least a month, with clinical and analytical control by its primary care doctor to objectify subsequent analytical normalization, in addition to abundant hydration and indications for which they should re -consult the emergency department."
"Reason for consultation
Dyspnea, cough and fever.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Anamnesis: 84 -year -old male who goes to our consultation referring to dyspnea next to cough, the increasing whitish expectoration as well as thermometer fever of 37.1oc of 48 hours of evolution.

As a more relevant personal history, a long -evolving COPD stand out in treatment with household oxygen, arterial hypertension with hypertensive heart disease and congestive heart failure as well as benign prostate hypertrophy. Currently anticoagulated with Sintrom.

Exploration: The patient presented good general condition, was well hydrated and perfused and was conscious, oriented in the three spheres and collaborator.
It highlighted a cardiopulmonary auscultation with roncus and sibilances scattered in both pulmonary fields next to a 90% SAO2 and marked respiratory work with circulation and tachypnea. 38ooc consultation temperature.
The lower limbs were not edematous or with suggestive signs of deep vein thrombosis.

Complementary tests: an radiography was performed on post-prior and lateral thorax projections in an outpatient manner, in health center, where a right pulmonary condensation was evidenced next to the left pleural spill. In this way, and given the exploration presented by the patient, his referral to reference hospital for extension of analytical tests is decided.

Hemogram and blood biochemistry is requested together with serology for pneumococcus, legionel pneumophila. The serology for the previous microorganisms was negative. In hemogram, 15000 leukococytes are evidenced with the rest of the normal blood series. As for biochemistry, he highlighted a PCR in 20.45, being the renal function as well as the rest of normal devices.

Family and community approach
He lives with his wife and is independent for ABVD and AIVD. It has good family support, with medium-low socio-economic level. Perform regular monitoring of its chronic pathology in health center.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Clinical judgment 1: Pneumonia acquired in the community.
Clinical judgment 2: Decompensated heart failure.

Parasitosis (tricuriasis, had) vs. Remains of mucosa and vegetables (false had).
Pancreatic or hepatic insufficiency: steatorreic feces and with intact muscle fibers. Food intolerances: gluten, celiacy.
Non -parasitic digestive infections.

Action and Evolution Plan
Mebendazole 100 mg was administered, unique dose, as an empirical treatment thinking of tricuriasis, although morphologically it could be more similar to had. We wait for microbiological diagnosis to add or not eradicating treatment in front of the vs. nematod Platelminto, and finally discarding parasitosis, since we were facing a patient with the diminished intestinal transit when presenting a basic neurological disease, it was not necessary to administer it.

Evolution: The patient evolved without incident, without abdominal pain or new referred stories."

"Reason for consultation
""I feel anxious.""

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Anamnesis: 38 -year -old female patient, who last day suffers an episode of anxiety for the second time at work (first episode 2 weeks ago), feeling pressure in the chest, unable to speak, in general ""very bad."" He suffers Sincope after anxiety crisis, attending a private hospital where Diazepam and High home were given, recommending getting an appointment with a psychiatrist.
2 weeks ago he began to find himself wrong at work with a lot of sleep and tiredness. A Redbull was bought, which took after 2-3 previous coffees, and began to feel worse. He manifested cloudy view, tachycardia, general discomfort and started hyperventilar. They knocked her up for 30 minutes and then took her home.
It is diagnosed with anguish disorder and temporary disability begins. Treatment with Lorazepam 1 mg on demand is guilty and cited in 1 week for first psychological interview in the health center.
Monitoring: In psychotherapy the patient tells us about the problems in their relationship and with their parents. He says that they live together but that there are many discussions. The father drinks alcohol more than logical. He bothers him that he drinks more and has responsibilities (such as picking up the children).
In her marital life she believes that she carries all the weight of the activities and that the husband sees normal that the woman does most of the home: picking up the children, lifting them, fixing backpacks, taking them where grandparents, washing clothes, and other issues of coexistence. He currently feels doubts in his relationship.
In addition, problems with his eldest son, who is seeing a psychologist after receiving news from his tutor at the school he tells him presents a lot of shyness, is very introverted, he looks sad.

Family and community approach
The patient is married and has two boys. It is an entire nuclear family. The patient lives at home with her husband and children. It has a stable job and a seemingly good social network.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Depressive syndrome (major depressive episode). Anguish disorder.

Action and Evolution Plan
Anxiolytic treatment is added: 50mg/day sertraline. Help activities are recommended (such as writing your thoughts and feelings in a notebook). He quotes again to continue with his psychological interviews.

Evolution: In 2nd psychotherapy refers to persistence of fatigue and fatigue; However, improvement with crying and their family theme (better conversation with them). You still don't feel like leaving home, despite being going out to pick up your children and visit your parents. He has written a little in his notebook. This day has been left with a friend. With certain people if he wanted to see him, with another he does not want to cross. He has stopped smoking. The patient looks easily to crying and difficulty reading their book notes. Setraline dose is increased to 100 mg/day.

In 3rd psychotherapy he tells us that he attended Mutua a few days ago. They mentioned that medication takes a long time to take effect. Refers to being more active. You want to leave more from home. It manifests improvement in your family relationship. He has continued writing in his notebook. Continue without smoking. He frequently meets several good friends who give her emotional support. You are advised to continue medication.

He is reading a book (novel) that his sister recommended, he loves. TA: 117/74 mmHg. Continue with medication.

In 7th psychotherapy is very good. He had an emotional management problem at work, but knew how to solve it. We thank us for the positive progress he has had to date and tells us ""without his help, doctors, he would not have succeeded."" If you get a complete response, the treatment must continue at least for 6 more months with the same dose with which healing is achieved to avoid relapses."

Differential diagnosis: venous thrombosis in the upper limb in patient with non -anticoagulated FA. Gota attack.

Action and Evolution Plan
Ceftriaxone 2 G IV is administered and hospital emergencies is derived for assessment with suspected infectious bursitis, unable to rule out venous thrombosis in a patient with a history of atrial fibrillation.

In hospital emergencies they perform analytics: normal hemogram with known platelet, PCR 100, D 900 Dimer. They refer to rapid infectious consultation in 48 h and initiate antibiotic treatment orally at home with cefadroxyl 500 mg/12 h.

"Reason for consultation
83 -year -old male patient who comes from a day fever of evolution without apparent focus.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Personal history of: arterial hypertension. Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (SAOS). Benign prostate hypertrophy. Renal polychymosis. Gotosa arthritis. Alzheimer's disease.
The patient lives at home with his wife and daughter. It is dependent for some daily life activities although it leads an active life, he always goes to the health center accompanied by one of his daughters.

The patient comes to consult with his daughter for presenting a day of an evolution of 38-39o. They refer coughing with occasional whitish expectoration. There is no other apparent focus on anamnesis. The only thing that the daughter, main caretaker, tells us is that he finds it with more forgetfulness and occasional disorientation (for example, he forgets that he has dinner) especially at night and coinciding with the fever. There is nothing striking to the exploration and the patient presents good general condition, although we find it decayed. When a fragile patient considers it, we started amoxicillin 750mg in a prophylactic way.
The next day we made home notice, sued by the family because the patient remains with a fever. Again we do not find focus. The patient continues with good general condition, hemodynamically stable and with anodine exploration. We reassure the family and explain that the process will last several days with maintained fever, but that they must be attentive to new symptoms that may appear and guide diagnosis. The patient accompanies us to the exit of his home to say goodbye.

We receive new demand at home a day later since the patient presents a great worsening. The family tells us that the patient had woken up well, but that he was declined and went to rest in his room, finding it later disoriented and with generalized rigidity.

To the exploration the patient is disoriented in time and space, with a tendency to sleep and responds incongruous to our questions.

Exploration (difficult due to lack of collaboration):
Constants: TA 129/73, FC 117LPM, Sato2 90%, T 38.6o, Glycemia 137.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation: without blows, rhythmic. MVC without added noises.
Globulous abdomen, not masse, not painful, not peritonism.
Lower members: without edema or signs of thrombosis.
Neurological: reactive bilateral myosis. Apparently preserved oculomotor movements. Erasure left nasogenian. Rest of non -valuable cranial pairs. Great instability in the march. No loss of striking sensitivity. Loss of generalized force. Kernig and Burdzinsky not valuable by voluntary defense, although there is apparent rigidity.

It is decided to send the patient to hospital emergencies to perform complementary tests.
Upon arrival, among the tests carried out:
Analytical: PCR 0.9mg/dl, leukocytes 10330/Œºl with 67% neutrophils and 17.9% lymphocytes. Platelets 186000/Œºl. Urine systematic with proteinuria.

Chest radiography: bad technique. Cardiotoral index within the limits of normality. Free parenchyma without congestion or condensations.
TAC Skull: Prominence of grooves, fissures and tanks with moderate dilation of the ventricular system in relation to corticosubcortical atrophy and/or senile involution. Adequate Gray-Blanca substance differentiation. Posterior fossa without findings. No signs of intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect. Rest of study without findings.

During their emergency room the patient has neurological deterioration, progressively somnolling himself, waking up only with painful stimuli. It is decided to perform a lumbar puncture, obtaining a slightly cloudy liquid and whose biochemistry is: 12/Œºl leukocytes (100% mononuclear), glucose 77mg/dl, proteins 70.9mg/dl.
Gram's staining is negative.
The PCRS study detects positive PCR for single-type herpes virus (VHS-1).

Family and community approach
Nuclear family structure. The patient coexists with his wife and one of his two daughters.
Its family life cycle, considering the WHO model modified by De la Revilla, is framed in stage IV or contraction (since the first child leaves the home until the last one does).
The youngest daughter lives with her parents, being the main caregiver of both, especially of the father, who needs more attention to being more fragile than her wife.

Clinical judgment
Meningencephaitis by VHS-1. The differential diagnosis that we raised at the beginning of the process was an acute confusional syndrome. Subsequently, other infections of the central nervous system must be taken into account and, with the biochemical values ‚Äã‚Äãof the CSF, you have to think about other viral infections, very early, aborted or tuberculous meningencephalitis bacterial. Other diagnoses would be autoimmune, metabolic, toxic or ischemic encephalitis.

Action and Evolution Plan
The patient enters infectious diseases and begins treatment with acyclovir IV (10mg/kg every 8 hours).

Evolution
The patient remains throughout the disoriented income, with incoherent answers to the questions asked, but at first he begins to eat crushed foods and is hemodynamically stable, without fever.
On the sixth day the patient presents important deterioration, not opening his eyes and just locating painful stimuli. Oliguria with 100cc diuresis in 12 hours despite intensive fluid therapy. Urgent analytics is performed where 5.6mg/dl is observed. It is possibly due to acute tubular necrosis by acyclovir, so it is readjusted by decreasing it to a daily dose.
Amoxicillin 875mg/Clavulanic 125mg is added by not being able to rule out aspiration, since it begins again with fever, cough and increased secretions.
Progressive deterioration that finally requires the sedation of the patient who dies on the eleventh day of admission."
"Reason for consultation
Distal paralesthesia in both lower members

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
55 -year -old male patient who goes to their health center for starting with a feverish picture of up to 38OC of 5 days of evolution, without other associated symptoms. The exploration highlights hyperemic pharynx without other findings of interest. It is diagnosed with acute pharyngitis and treated with azithromycin, acetylcysteine ‚Äã‚Äãand paracetamol.

After 10 days of evolution of the febrile painting and once resolved, he consults again for presenting distal parstesties in both lower members and in 3o-4o right finger associated with quadriceps weakness and tidal sensation, maintaining the ability to walk. Deglutory, phonatory and respiratory difficulty denies. Non -gastrointestinal clinic. The exploration highlights exhaustion and lack of strength with the gear on tiptoe and heels and osteotendinososos hemicstandinous reflexes. Given the findings, your doctor decides to derive it to the emergency department of the hospital for complementary test assessment and discard possible Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. In the emergency, cranial CT with a result of nonspecific hyperdense lesion in 9x7mm left frontal subcortical white substance, without associated perilesional edema effect that does not have enhancement with intravenous contrast administration.

Admission is decided and during your hospital stay it is made:
General Analytics including: Hemogram; Biochemistry with renal, liver and ions function; thyrotropin; Hepatitis A, B and C virus serologies, parvovirus B19, Campylobacter jejuni, Treponema Pallidum, Borrelia Burgdorferi, Citomegalovirus, Herpes simple, HIV, rubella and varicella-zoster; ANN; Antimog antibodies Antigangli√≥sidic antibodies: all normal or negative.
Lumbar puncture: Proteins 87.9, Leukocytes 2, PCR of negative neurotropic viruses. Culture of negative liquid.
Cranial NMR to expand study of the lesion detected in CT: it is confirmed occupant of intraparenquimatous left space left, of heterogeneous intensity, with hyperintensus center and hypointensus halo. Findings in relation to Cavernoma.

Electroneurophysiological study: normal. There are no significant alterations in the sensitive-motor conduction or in the reflex F response of the explored nerves of the four limbs (N. Medium, ulnar, peroneal, posterior tibial, suural and superficial peroneal).

Family and community approach
He works as a janitor of two buildings. His wife does not work. He has a daughter with Down syndrome. He has the full and total support of his family during his hospital stay.

Clinical judgment (differential diagnosis)
Clinical judgment: Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. Left frontal cavernoma as an incidental finding.
As differential diagnoses that have been discarded with complementary tests are: miasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, acute viral polyomyelitis, botulism, borreliosis (Lyme disease) and acute hypocalemic paralysis.

Action and Evolution Plan
During your income, intravenous immunoglobulins are administered with good and fast clinical response of proximal crural weakness.

It does not need to discharge. He is reviewed in the neurology consultation after two months, the patient after progressive improvement during his admission and in later days, was asymptomatic. It has an upcomed neurology review in a year."
"Reason for consultation
Patient who comes to primary care consultation for presenting for approximately a month Charter characterized by paresthesia, dyssesthesia and muscle spasm from knees to distal level of lower limbs, especially in twins.

As usual treatment, it takes 100mg/24h and omeprazole 20mg/24h.
Consultation for presenting a picture of paresthesia, dyssesthesia and muscle cramps in lower limbs, predominant in twins, one month of evolution. In successive consultations since primary care, symptoms have been progressing and extended to the medium nerve territory of the left hand despite analgesic and adjuvant treatment.

Systematic exploration
Good general condition, eupneic at rest, normohydrate and normocolored, conscious, oriented and collaborator.
Cardiorespiratory auscultation: rhythmic tones without blows, friction or extra -extras. Vesicular murmullo preserved without pathological noises.
Abdomen: soft and depressible without mass palpation or megalias. Not painful to palpation. No peritoneal defense.
Ex neurological: normoreactive isocoric pupils, no alteration of cranial scope, not loss of strength or tone, parstesties and increased painful sensitivity in both lower members. You would not have. Negative romerg. Normal march.
Members: Las Segative and Discreet Livedo Reticularis with skin atrophy at the lower limb level, such as venous insufficiency data. Preserved pulses. Rot here abolished and exalted left styloradial, normal rest.

Complementary tests
From Primary Care, analytics was performed with:
Normal hemogram
Biochemistry with slight alteration of GGT (88 U/L) and CPK (281 mcg/l). Ions within normality.
Syphilis serology.
B12 and folic acid within normality.
Normal thyroid hormones.
A lumbar level radiography was also performed where pathological images are not observed.

Given the persistence of symptoms and the little response to hygienic-dietary, analgesia and adjuvant measures, it is decided to derive the case to the specialist for analytical expansion and complementary tests.
In this analytics we find:
Normal hemogram
Biochemistry: Lead 3.5 mcg/dl (n <40mcg/dl), copper 135mg/l (n 70 - 140), creatinine and urea within normality, normal ions, discreet increase of GOT, LPG and GGT, LDH 182 U/L (135 - 225U/L), ECA 50 U/L (8 - 52 U/L) g/dl (6.6 -8.7 g/dl), albumin 4.6 g/dl (3.4 -4.8 g/dl), PCR 0.2 mg/dl (0 -0.5 mg/dl), antiestreptolisin or 78 U/ml (0 -200u/ml), FR 67.8 U/ml (0 -14 U/ml), C4 and C3C.
24h urine: creatinine, calcium, phosphate and urate within normality. Normal porphyrins.
Immunology:
Immunofijaci√≥n: Monoclonal component in normal serum.
Autoimmunity: IgA, IGM, IgG, Ana, Antimpo, Antipr3, anti negative glomerular basal membrane. VHC 2450000 RNA viral load (positive 1b).
Serology: (anti - HBC) Core HB Negative, AC in front HC positive, AC compared to HIV 1/2 negative.
Proteinogram: Total proteins, albumin, globulins within normality.
A ENG-EMG of members was also performed, where a moderate axonal axonal polyneuropathy of sensitive predominance in lower limbs, and a RNM of skull and lumbar column that do not show pathological findings is evidenced.
Given the diagnosis of HPC hepatopathy, treatment with interferon and ribavirin begins. Despite the correct treatment and after its completion, the patient continues to present the same clinic, even a worsening of the symptoms. Given the bad evolution, other diagnoses are thought of differences and that is when we realize that our patient holds amalgama for many years, so analytical study is expanded again with another heavy metal not previously contemplated, mercury. A total blood mercury of 22 mcg/l (n <10 mcg/l), and total urine of 2 mcg/g creatinine (n <30mcg/l) was evidenced.

Given these new findings, treatment with D - Penicilamine 250mg/6h and withdrawal of amalgam dental prostheses begins. In successive analytical controls the level of mercury in blood is descending and we find significant clinical improvement.

Family and community approach

Action and Evolution Plan
Due to the treatment with D - Penicilamine, the patient was presenting progressive improvement, with less cramps, improvement in the sensitivity of the fingertips and feet, the alternation between hyperalgesia - prior hypoalgesia has been normalized, only a slight numbness persists. Subsequently in consultation reviews, it has suffered by ways of outbreaks increase in symptomatology, and in control analytics it has been possible to observe a new increase in mercury level, so it has had to return to treatment with D - Penicillinamine on several occasions. In addition, after the treatment with interferon and ribavirin the viral load has been confirmed as negative."

Anamnesis: Contraindicated NSAIDs by gastric ulcer. No smoker. Non-drinker. HERNIA DISCAL L4-L5.
IQ: Appendicectomy, prayers, left knee prostheses in November 2012.
76 -year -old male patient who goes to your primary care doctor for decayed mood and paint of pain and difficulty flexing the right knee of months of evolution. In 2012 it was operated from the left knee by gonarrosis and rehabilitation begins forcing the weight in the right knee. He says that one day he feels general discomfort described as whip in the whole body, at which time he begins with a contracture in both knees presenting them flexed and with mottled march since then. Little by little it loses force to the point that the patient begins to use a wheelchair. The pain is intense and prevents night rest.
No sensitive loss, no motor loss, no alteration of sphincters.
According to the family, the patient's depressive picture is important with spontaneous crying, suicidal ideations and abulia. At this time, interconsultation is decided with mental health since the patient had not suffered previously mood disorders.

Physical exploration
BEG, AFEBRIL. Preserved superior functions. Normal language and campimetry. Pinla MOEC Normal cranial paris. Motor balance in MMSS preserved and symmetric. Rots noted and here present ++/++++. No loss of muscle mass. Not clear spasticity. Change the muscle tone with distraction maneuvers. Right thigh hyperalgesia. Flexo of the right knee of 45 is appreciated with enormous difficulty in the extension. 20o flexo in the left knee.

Complementary tests
Normal analytics.
TC skull without significant alterations.
Neurophysiological conduction study show values ‚Äã‚Äãin normal limits. Denervative activity is not found in the explored muscles (isolated fasciculations in twin).
Bone gammography: pathological increase in osteoblastic activity in bruises compatible with possible condropathy. Degenerative changes. Crushing L1.
NMR column (no skull could be performed): cervical myelopathy. Degenerative signs with numerous protusions.
Knee NMR: severe right gonartrosis and to a lesser extent Femorotibial internal compartment with internal meniscopathy without meniscus breakage.

Family and community approach
The patient is the father of two healthy children and currently lives with his wife. Retired entrepreneur. Coexist with a dog.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Flexo painting of both knees and alteration of the march of psychogen origin. Intervened cervical myelopathy.
Idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

Action and Evolution Plan
During the course of 5 years, the patient is valued by traumatology, rehabilitation, pain unity, neurosurgery and neurology due to worsening of the painting without reaching an etiological diagnosis. Infiltrations with botulinum toxin, corticosteroids and anesthetic, getting momentary relief but maintains joint stiffness despite the guided treatments are carried out. Traumatology decides reduction with general anesthesia but in the intervention does not yield the knee flexo (45o) and on the left knee (operated) has a flexo of 30o. In the NMR of column a cervical myelopathy without symptoms in MMSS in neurosurgery follow -up that after years its intervention is decided. Cure without incident.
In one of the neurology consultations a bilateral resting tremor is seen in MMSS with slight associated stiffness and a Spect-FP is requested to rule out Parkinson. The study is pathological with decreased dopamine transporters, indicative of nigroestriatal degeneration."
"Reason for consultation
Headache and dizziness.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
52 -year -old male without other personal history than HIV infection of more than 10 years of evolution, with good immunovirological control (CD4 950 Cell/ŒºL, CD8 853 Cell/ŒºL, leukocytes 5.010 x103/Œºl, undetectable viral load) that performs treatment inhibitors of reverse transcriptase analogous nucleosides, without having suffered defining complications of defining complications of defining complications of defining complications of defining complications of defining complications AIDS; Therefore in a A1 stadium. He consulted for holocranial headache and dizziness of 15 days of evolution, also associating drowsiness of diurnal predominance, asthenia and anorexia increasing in recent weeks and weight loss of 5 kg in addition to profuse sweating without chills and razors. The patient expresses to be overwhelmed because he feels that in recent weeks he forgets everyday things and says he has unmotivated crying spontaneously.

The exploration was conscious, oriented and collaborator, eupneic at rest and hemodynamically stable, with cardiopulmonary auscultation and anodine abdominal exploration. At the neurological level, only the presence of a pathological romerg, and minimal gestural facial paralysis was striking, without presenting at the time, nor other signs of meningeal irritation, as well as other neurological focus at the level of cranial pares lethargy of movements, which was even evident to the patient.

- Craneal CT: hyperdense brain loe, at the level of the corpus callosum, which crosses the midline and contacts the epidemic, with perilesional edema and slight mass effect on the posterior antlers of the lateral ventricles, highly suggestive of primary brain lymphoma.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
The first diagnosis that occurred in the emergency room for subsequent income, was brain injury compatible with primary brain lymphoma in HIV A1 patient, which after this finding becomes classified as stadium C1.

Action and Evolution Plan
It was entered into internal medicine to expand study with cranial RNM with contrast, Bodytac (both image tests without different findings than those of the cranial CT) and an analysis with positive IgG CMV serology with negative IGM, IgG toxoplasma positive negative IGM, lymphocyte subpopulations with CD4 954 Cell/Œºl with indetectable viral load. During admission, he referred to find himself much better referring to his headaches after corticosteroid treatment. Right facial paralases persists with positive romerg which was negative after several days of corticosteroid treatment.
Neurosurgery was contacted for the assessment of oncological treatment.
At the ethical level, we are raised by the following dilemma, since relatives, who do not know the immunodeficiency associated with HIV infection suffered by the patient, request that the patient not be informed about his current disease or the severity of it. Given this double pact of silence, the family doctor who will continue to value him in successive consultations has an intermediary and communicative role to give the pertinent explanations to the patient and relatives without speaking directly of his pathology, at least so far that he himself refers to us."

Family and community approach
21 -year -old male who lives with their parents and a healthy brother. He works as a computer programmer. It does not refer infectious history in the family or TB. It has two cats and a dog for years, well vaccinated.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Polyadenopathic syndrome by nonspecific reactive lymphadenitis. Suspicion of Kikuchi-Fujimoto syndrome.
Infectious piomiositis in the sternocleidomastoid.

Action and Evolution Plan
The evolution was favorable, the patient is admitted for study for 7 days and refers to improvement with administered antibiotics and antit√©rmics. It also shows a decrease in the lesion until it is resolved at the end of your stay in the plant.
Ten months later, the patient suffers the same clinical picture but on the contralateral side, this time is performed that discovers new adenopathies supra and infradiafragmatic with a benign histology. The diagnostic process was extended for 2 years since it is a diagnosis of exclusion. The patient has currently requested an appointment with his family doctor for the appearance of a new axillary adenopathy. It is pending analytics, abdominal and axillary ultrasound."
"Reason for consultation
19 -year -old patient who goes to primary care consultation for continuous cough of three weeks of evolution.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Patient of 19 years of Spanish nationality, teaching student. Personal background of the right branch of the His beam, rhinoconjuntivitis allergic and mild asthma. It has no family history of interest. In salbutamol treatment on demand. It does not present medication allergies. Take alcoholic beverages occasionally. No smoker.

The patient comes to the consultation for presenting a dry cough of three weeks of evolution of increasing intensity that interferes in the night rest. Increases with exercise. Mild rhinorrhea. It has no dyspnea and auscultation is normal. Partial improvement using salbutamol on demand. Given the personal history, it is decided to start 160 mcg/formterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg 2 inhalations every 12 hours.

He returns two months later due to coughing with greenish expectoration and a two -day fever of evolution. Auscultation presents crepitants on the left base, so amoxicillin 875mg/ Clavulanic 125mg is guilty every 8 hours for 7 days with improvement in the painting. In spite of this, he goes again three weeks later because the cough persists, with increased access the last week and with whitish expectoration. That same morning hemptoic expectoration. It also presents again inconstantly, reaching 39-40o, of evening predominance and with nightly sweating. Pain in anterior part of the right -type right hemithorax. Do not dyspnea. In addition, deepening anamnesis, parents refer to 6-7 kg weight loss in recent months. He has not made trips.

Exploration: Good general condition, Normohydrate, Normoperfundido, Eupneico at rest. Constants: TA: 114/59, FC 104LPM, Sato2 99%, T 37.8o.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic, without blows. Vesicular Murmullo preserved without added noises.

Radiography is requested urgently where it is observed:
Extensive lesion cavited in the upper right lobe with hydroa√©reo level. Others smaller at the base. Alveolo-interstitial infiltrate Nodulillar in left hemithorax, suggestive of bronchogenic dissemination.

Hospital emergencies is derived for complementary tests and pneumology assessment. The most relevant results of the tests performed are:
ANALYTICS: C -reactive protein 142, procalcitonin 0.07, leukocytes 14590/Œºl with 93%neutrophilia. Hemoglobin 12 g/dl, 36%hematocrit, medium corpuscular volume 76.7FL, platelets 430000/Œºl.

Sputum bacilloscopy: Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA is detected with sensitivity to all sentences.
During his emergency stay, the patient remained with good general condition, hemodynamically stable and little expectoration, with small number of blood remains.
The patient has good family support, adequate understanding of the diagnosis. Need for disease transmission prevention, so it is decided high with domicile treatment and insulation.

Family and community approach
In full nuclear family structure, the patient coexists with both parents and older brother. Although at first the patient was anxious at home given the possibility of transmission of the disease, there was good family support at all times, which promoted treatment at home.

Clinical judgment (problem list, differential diagnosis)
Cavited pulmonary tuberculosis. The case raised various differential diagnoses: bronchial hyperreactivity or respiratory path infection. We must also think about other pathologies that present hemoptysis, such as bronchogenic carcinoma; o Cavitated lesions, with infectious causes (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, nocardiosis, actinomycosis, aspergilosis or histotoplasmosis), neoplastic (bronchioalveolar and carcinoid cancer), rheumatological (granulomatosis with Poliageitis) and others.

Action and Evolution Plan
The patient began treatment at home with rifampicin 150/Isoniazida 75/pyrazinamide 400/etambutol hydrochloride 275mg 4 tablets/24h for two months with good tolerance, then changing to rifampicin 300/isociacida 150mg 2 tablets/24h, which currently takes and with which it will remain between 4-7 months. The first month was at home for respiratory isolation.
Evolution
We went to see the patient a week for review. He continued with occasional fever and cough. Anxiety about the painting, especially because their mother and 22 -year -old brother are done the IGRA test (Gamma Interferon Liberation Test), being positive for both, so he had feelings of guilt.
Seen so far four times by pneumology. Good evolution of the painting, currently occasional.
Analytical tests are performed in all consultations, with improvement of acute phase reactants, serology of HIV and negative hepatitis, and new sputum bacilloscopy at two months negative for BAAR.
In control radiography at four and a half months there is significant improvement, with disappearance of infiltrates in the left lung. The right lung is in regression, with scar appearance, persisting image of cavity in the upper right lobe.
Pending again control by pneumology.
The whole cohabiting family is performed by the IGRA test, being positive for their mother and brother.
The father is done again by eight weeks persisting negative.
The mother and brother are ruled out active tuberculosis performing chest radiography and sputum culture. They initiate chemoprophilactic treatment with isoniacida 300mg/24h for 9 months, with adequate tolerance."
"Reason for consultation
6 -year -old girl goes with her parents to consultation by referring these fever, cough and mucos of four days of evolution treated with physical and antitermal measures without clinical improvement. After complete exploration with pathological respiratory auscultation and with normal thorax radiography it is treated with doses of azithromycin suspecting atypical pneumonia, presumably improving. Three months later, having found until then asymptomatic, he goes for skin lesions in lateral trunk regions, buttocks and thighs, which we begin to study with the help of complementary tests.

Individual approach
As the only personal history of interest, to highlight atopic dermatitis, it was correctly vaccinated and no medication allergies were known. He had not had any interest or relationships with animals different from those already experienced. As a family history there is no interest findings.
In May, the patient consulted for a four -day fever of evolution, coughs and mucus that after pulmonary auscultation with over -added crackles decided to request chest x -ray, not presenting in it condensations we consider a possible atypical pneumonia and prescribe azithromycin three days, improving in 48 hours.
Three months later he goes with polymorphic lesions of type papules and erythematous and edematous plaques in addition to vesicles and a pathognomonic lesion ""in Diana"" (he has three concentric rings and sometimes a central hemorrhagic vesicle). They were pruriginous but there were no signs of impetiginization or other complications, we prescribed dexclorfeniramina to improve the pruritus and indicate seeing evolution.
Days later his worried mother comes because the injuries were spreading, mainly in buttocks and thighs, asymptomatic for the girl. We decided to stay expectant and review the patient in a few weeks.
The girl goes to the planned appointment with both parents presenting the same lesions, without pruritus since she used the prescribed antihistamine treatment. His parents, for concern and uncertainty, demand some complementary evidence and another assessment to clarify the reason for injuries. We believed a clinical diagnosis of multiform erythema minor, since it also has pathognomonic lesion, but given such concern we request evidence and refer to specialist.
In complementary explorations, an analytical, biochemistry and parameters of acute phase reactants in range and serology with positive IGM for mycoplasma pneumoniae, without other findings, stands out. They go to dermatology consultation who proposes to use azithromycin and/or acyclovir guidelines, which in principle we do not follow; Yes, we ask for a new analytics and observe the quadruplication of the degree concluding that it is a skin -induced skin reaction.
After weeks and with repetition of outbreaks of the skin lesions, the parents remained uneasy and demanded healing treatment.

Family and community approach
Regarding their family structure, they make up a nuclear family with close relatives (her parents, her older brother and she live at home) without any stressful vital event to highlight. Nutritious family style, with family union, parenting and adaptation to the needs and stimulating interests of their preschool and school age. We can catalog according to the Duvall model: Consolidation and Opening Stage IV of the family life cycle.

Clinical judgment
Today there is controversy regarding the lesions group where we classify our case: Multiform Erythema MINOR (EMM). Much authors continue to classify multiform erythema, Stevens-Johnson (SSJ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (NET) as different expressions of the same clinical-patological entity, differentiating according to extension, severity and possible trigger factor (vs. vs. drugs). The EMM are recurrent or not acute lesions, self-limited that has no mucous membranes or is minimal and heal without sequelae, normally in 2-4 weeks, although sometimes they can be chronified as our case, which in particular would be erythema multiform chronificed minor minor. The Emmayor cures also without sequelae but can produce acute outbreaks and there is mucous affectation. The SSJ are non -self -limited acute injuries that also include visceral manifestations. Finally, the net is progressive, is triggered by drugs and also affect internal organs with a fulminant course.
The diagnosis is mostly a clinical combined with histological if necessary. Laboratory findings in the Emmenor are normal; In Emmayor there may be an increased globular sedimentation rate, moderate leukocytosis and slight increase in transaminases; And in the SSJ and Net there is fever and laboratory findings will depend on the degree of affectation of the internal organs.

Plan of action
After the diagnosis and having already treated MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIEE infection months ago, now proposing to improve the dermatological picture, we explain to the parents that there is no consensual management of the chronificed emine, and even less in the pediatric age. There is controversy regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids, it is not demonstrated that they shorten the duration of the disease and could be associated with an increase in the frequency of shoots and their chronicity. We propose expectation.
Two weeks later, with persistence of injuries, parents have inclined to try corticosteroid treatment. We indicate prednisone at dose of 1mg/kg/day during the shoots until the disappearance of the lesions, at which time we will reduce the dose.

Evolution
The girl was still going with her parents to the consultation for mild skin shoots every 10-15 days.
While in the middle of winter, it was decided to treat only the pruritus. The clinic course lasted from 9 to 10 months to spontaneous remission."

51 -year -old male patient without pathological history of interest who goes to consultation to renew the medication of his wife. We review previous analytics of this patient and make sure that it has a leukocytosis with left deviation in two previous analytics and indicates the analytical one. The patient is completely asymptomatic at the present time. Without presence of B symptoms. In the last year he has had two episodes of gouty arthritis in the first phalanx of the right foot that have been resolved with NSAIDs and mats.
In September 2015 he had a hemogram with 16650/Œºl leukocytes at the expense of neutrophils (13020/Œºl), in March 2016 they went down to 12160/Œºl (neutrophils 8950/Œºl).

Family and community approach
M is the husband and main caretaker of another patient from our 49 -year -old quota who is in a vegetative state after 10 years ago a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. M is completely overturned in the care of his wife and always goes to our consultation for her care efforts. My tutor and I periodically go to value his wife at home. M is little consultant and, despite the numerous occasions in which we have attended by consultations referring to his wife, he barely has open consultation sheets. His concern and daily effort are in the impeccable care of his wife. Undervalue your state of health and your own problems. M is a compliant patient and collaborator but sometimes there is a lack of extractions of blood or appointments because he puts the care of his wife to his own health. It is extremely complex to address psychological issues regarding the recent diagnosis of his illness because for him it is not a problem, for him it would only be a problem that something happened to his wife, although she has been disconnected from the environment for years.

Clinical trial (list of problems, referential diagnosis)
Leukocytosis with neutrophilia maintained by study.
Psychosocial problems of the main patient caregiver with great dependence

Plan of action
Given the results obtained in the peripheral blood smear and maintained leukocytosis, the patient was referred to the hematology and hemotherapy consultation.

Evolution
In the hematology and hemotherapy consultation, the study has been completed and has been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia with positive philadelphia chromosome.
In November 2017, treatment with chemotherapy began, they prescribe Hydrea at a dose of 1000 mg alternating with 500 mg since, although being asymptomatic, the leukocyte count had risen to 46480/Œºl with a neutrophilia of 84000/Œºl, and thrombocytosis of 404000/Œºl. They also guided allopurinol 300 mg for breakfast and abundant hydration due to the hyperuricemia it presented due to cell lysis (uric acid 8). In the review appointment, the leukocyte formula remained at similar levels so they modify the treatment and begin Nilotinib 300 mg c/ 12 hours.
This last treatment has tolerated it correctly and has been effective. The patient is currently asymptomatic and with a normal leukocyte formula: leukocytes 8700/Œºl neutrophils 6500/Œºl and platelets 300000/Œºl."
"Reason for consultation

Individual approach
Anamnesis: 69 -year -old patient who refers to muscle overload of a month of evolution who has treated physiotherapy with relative improvement, and who has been reacted this pain for 5 days, treating it again with physiotherapy and local cold, achieving the cold a greater relief of pain.
Exploration: there is an increase in the diameter and erythema of the lower left limb, as well as increase in local temperature and fake compared to the contralateral lower limb.
ANALYTICS: In a first analytics carried out in the medical examination of his company that the patient contributed, on 09/29/2017, a leukocytosis (21,000) was observed with lymphocytosis (15,600/74.4%), so it was decided to repeat the hemogram to confirm these findings, and expand the study with serologies and cytomorphology. Leukocytosis (28,000) with lymphocytosis (20.270 / 72.4%), and positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus was evidenced again in the analytics.

Complementary tests:
Left MMII Ecodoppler (09/20/2017): Partially recanalized and south -south -eating thrombosis. Femoral venous system in good condition. Arterial system within normality. Clinical judgment: TVP Sural Popliteal.
Cytomorphology (11/30/2017): Mature Lymphocytes of small size with condensed chromatin nucleus, abundant shadows of Grumpetch, not blast cells. Lymphoproliferative syndrome B type chronic lymphatic leukemia (LLC).
Family and community approach
Active patient labor as a freelancer being a manager of a hamm company. It does not present important diseases currently in its list of problems, and also performed around two hours of daily physical exercise prior to the appearance of thrombotic pathology.

The medical-patient relationship was previously absent to this episode because the patient only required sporadic health care with intervals of full years between consultations, as of these episodes it has begun in a favorable way.

Clinical judgment
The presentation of the symptoms: increase in the diameter and erythema of the lower left limb, as well as increase in local temperature and fake compared to the lower contralateral limb. And although asymptomatic, presence of leukocytosis with analytical lymphocytosis. There was a possible deep venous thrombosis and Pathology of the White series to study.
As differential diagnoses it should be taken into account: deep venous thrombosis vs. cellulite vs. musculoskeletic pathology. White series pathology. After assessing the medical history next to the symptomatology presented, a possible TVP is diagnosed by establishing treatment and being confirmed by the complementary tests days later. According to the analytical findings, the patient is referred to the hematology service to complete diagnostic study.
He currently presented in his list of problems: Saos with CPAPN, Cataracts (intervened) and distal polyneuropathy.

Action plan
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis with low molecular weight heparin and Godmina combined with hesperidine, confirming days later by angiology and vascular surgery service. PERVERATION TO THE HEMATOLOGY SERVICE GIVEN THE ANALYTIC FINDINGS OBTAINED, as well as the results of cytomorphology.

Evolution
Currently, the first reason for consultation as was the deep vein thrombosis was resolved with the clinsed treatment. Regarding the derivation to the Hematology Service, the patient was seen in external consultations of said specialty at 3 days of being derived. The patient does not currently present symptoms B, and a Tac-Body was performed on 11/16/2017 in which no pathological alterations were found to highlight, or visceromegalias, or adenopathies, so they concluded the diagnosis of SD. Lymphoproliferative B type LLC Stadium A of Binnet, which currently does not require treatment and is pending review next February."

Globulous, soft and depressible abdomen, slightly painful to palpation in hypogastrium, without defense or other signs of peritonism. No masses or megalias are palpated. No ascites.
Lower limbs without edema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

Family and community approach
The patient lives with a caretaker and has 8 children who are going to visit him frequently. Among his children there is no agreement with respect to the patient's care, since not everyone has also assimilated the prognosis of their illness. It had a final income 1 month ago by sepsis of urinary origin. From the discharge, we have made scheduled visits at home every 2 days for the high comorbidity it has, and by the presence of frequent piuria every time an antibiotic cycle ends, to prevent new complications. The patient had deteriorated after admission but had an acceptable quality of life and remained stable clinically. His family was very demanding about the patient's medical care.

Clinical trial (list of problems, referential diagnosis)
Catarro of high tracks.

Plan of action
We start treatment with acetylcysteine ‚Äã‚Äãand paracetamol, in addition to maintaining their inhalers. We value the patient again the next day since one of his daughters warns us by telephone due to lack of improvement. When going to value it, we do not find changes with respect to the previous day. Still without a fever.

Evolution
The next morning to our second visit, the patient begins with a fever and his family decides to take him to the hospital for assessment.
There they perform several complementary tests. In the analytics HB 11.5 g/dl is detected; 20000 leukocytes; 94%neutrophils; 520000 platelets; Creatinine 4,895 mg/dl; Urea 186 mg/dl; Sodium 120 meq/l; Potassium 6, 2 mEq/L (Hemolyzed serum). An image of condensation in the upper third of right hemithorax appears on the thorax radiography. The flu PCR was negative for influenza A and B.
Given the findings, the patient is diagnosed with a pneumonia acquired in the community and admitted to the observation area. He had a bad evolution during the next 24 hours to admission, with progressive decrease in the level of consciousness and increased respiratory work. They warned the family of poor prognosis in the short term and finally died.
The next day one of his daughters called us to the consultation to give us the news. She was angry and reproached us not to have noticed before the painting. We transfer our discomfort by evolution and try to be understanding with the situation. However, we could not avoid staying with a very bad feeling because of what happened given the extensive care and dedication we had with the patient when necessary."

"Reason for consultation
Abdominal pain focused on right flank.

Individual approach (anamnesis, exploration, complementary tests)
Personal history: 50 -year -old woman. No known allergies. No toxic habits. No HTA, no DM, or dyslipremia. Primary hypothyroidism in substitute treatment with eutirox 50 mcg. Allergic rhinitis in antihistamine treatment on demand.
Anamnesis: It presents abdominal pain in the right flank of continuous deaf character of several days of evolution that is accompanied by nausea without vomiting, without fever. Pain is not modified with postures or analgesia. It does not associate with vusion syndrome. This led to his consultation in the emergency room.

Exploration: It presents good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Eupleic at rest. Well hydrated and perfidious. Normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. Soft depressible abdomen, painful to palpation in right hypochondrium where poorly defined induced mass is palpated, without erythema or direct signs of inflammation 3 cm in greater diameter. It has no signs of peritoneal irritation. Murphy and Blumberg Signs. Lower members: No edema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

Complementary tests: Complete blood analytics with normal hemogram, normal biochemistry, normal coagulation are requested. Also systematic urine with negative gestation test. ECO-TAC ABDOMEN is requested: Complex cystic lesion stands out on the subcapsular periphery of segment VI about 6.5 cm in diameter, rounded morphology, in which a fine, enhanced wall is identified and in which continuity solutions are not identified, with a presence in the ultrasound study of fine eco-giving content in suspension, as well as an echogenic undulating band and folding. intraluminal membrane. Associates thickening of anterior spherical fascia and ipsilateral lateoconal fascia, with adjacent fatty reticulation, findings considered inflammatory-reactive by neighborhood. Together these findings suggest hepatic cyst, possibly hydatid, complicated with a maintained break.

Family and community approach
Live with her husband and son. Natural of Italy. For 20 years he has lived in Spain. Medium-low socioeconomic status. He has lived with a dog for a year vaccinated and dewormed.

Clinical trial (list of problems, referential diagnosis)
Clinical judgment: Subagudo abdominal pain in right hypochondrium in probable relationship with complex hepatic cyst with contained rupture.
Differential diagnosis: simple hepatic cyst; Hydatid cyst; Hamartoma of bile ductus; Caroli's disease; Embryonic liver sarcoma; Biliary cystadenocarcinoma; Liver abscess; Cystic metastasis; Hepateceluular Adneoma


Plan of action
In the Emergency Department, given the symptomatology presented by the patient, it is decided to request an abdomen eco-tac to affiliate the origin of pain and the mass it presents to the exploration.

Evolution
In the Emergencies the analytics, both with blood and urine, was normal. In abdomen eco-tac, findings suggest, possibly hydatidic, complicated with contained rupture. For all these reasons, interconsultation of general surgery is performed that dismisses urgent surgical intervention, so it is decided to refer the patient to digestive system for study and affiliation of the cyst. It is decided to start treatment with albendazole 400mg/12 hours for a month and request complete analytics with liver biochemistry, PCR, CA19.9, CEA and normal hemogram, in addition to AFP, HIV, HBV, HCV and negative Echinoccus serology; In addition to TAC ABDOMEN C/C Tryphasic in August 2017 in which the size of the cystic lesion can be seen and where it is not possible to differentiate whether it is a simple biliary cyst or a hydatid cyst. In January 2018, complete serology is requested being negative for Echinococcus. During all this time the patient has not presented pain. So the diagnosis is simple liver cyst."
"Reason for consultation
11 -year -old boy with self -limited diarrhea and good general condition. A week later, it presents migratory cutaneous petechial. After five days with this ex -foretter, it is accentuated and begins with catarrhal symptoms and a feverish peak isolated from 38o, so it goes to the Emergency Department.

Individual approach
As a personal history to highlight, the patient has atopic dermatitis and cypress allergy. It is well vaccinated and has no known medication allergies.
As a family history they call attention: brother with suspected Celiac√≠a and IgA deficit. Paternal branch: several relatives with celiachy. Maternal branch: aunt with DMI and autoimmune thyroiditis.
In February, the patient consults in the emergency department for migratory petechial exanthema of a week of evolution. It begins in lower limbs and abdomen, later appearing on the back and upper members. The same day that he goes to the emergency department, nasal congestion and odinophagy, with a febrile peak isolated from 38o. Two weeks before, he recounts diarrhea frame without pathological products, self -limited.
In the exploration, generalized micropetechial exanthema is displayed that does not disappear at the pressure, more important in the lumbar region, abdomen and shoulders. Several hematomas in elbows without the patient remembering associated trauma. No active mucous bleeding, although if you comment frequent epistaxis without having presented episodes last week.
It has a normal respiratory auscultation and hyperemic oropharynx without exudates, petechiae in palate.
Due to this clinic, a idiopathic thrombocytopenic purple (PTI) is suspected, and analytics are performed where a platelet of 7,000/Œºl stands out. No alterations in other series or coagulation alterations.
Income into an oncohematology service and peripheral blood for study of PTI prior to treatment is decided.
Treatment with intravenous nonspecific human immunoglobulin is initiated 800mg/kg, with excellent clinical response and platelet ascent> 100,000 in 48 hours. As the only side effects, 37.4o and headache (Eva 5) that improves with usual analgesics are fever. It decides high after favorable evolution.
A week later, the patient goes to the consultation to receive results of analytical study, aimed at discarding active infections (HIV, CMV, VEB, CHS, VHA, VHB, VHC, TOXOPLASMA, VICELA-ZOSTER VIRUS AND RUBEOLA), systemic, autoimmune and hereditary diseases, without finding alterations.

Family and community approach
We speak in the case of the patient of a nuclear family, with good family support and good cultural level, so an adequate education is oriented to identify signs that indicate serious active bleeding.

Clinical judgment
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purple is an autoimmune origin painting caused by the appearance of antiplatelet antibodies that induce platelet destruction at the peripheral level. Our patient has a recent diagnosis (up to three months) and to which a disease that can be persistent and even chronify should be monitored.

Plan of action
The objective of treatment is the prevention of the hemorrhagic clinic and not the correction of the platelet figure. The treatment begins immediately in cases of active mucous bleeding.
Our patient has exclusively cutaneous bleeding, so PTI study extraction before starting treatment. The drugs used as the first line are prednisone/methylprednisolone IV in 3 doses or nonspecific human immunoglobulin IV a dose, without consensus or evidence of the advantage of one option over another.
Al disco, patient and family should monitor signs of mucous bleeding, urine color and appearance of bruises or petechiae. You should avoid traumatic risk activities and sports activity at first, changing this pattern subsequently according to evolution.

Evolution
Despite the recent diagnosis of the disease, we can say that it has a favorable evolution, with a quick response to immunoglobulin treatment. This patient must be monitored, controlling platelet figures, since the disease can be persistent or chronic."
"It is a 24 -year -old woman with unstable type 1 diabetes mellitus.
She was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of four after a metabolic syndrome, has extrinsic bronchial asthma (which she controlled with immunotherapy) and does not present chronic complications related to diabetes.
He presented a good metabolic control to puberty but since then he has had several income from diabetic ketoacidosis and bad chronic metabolic control (HBA1C = 11.8.)
2 years ago treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was established in pump with improvement of metabolic control (HBA1c = 8.2). However, within a few months, he entered with ketoacidosis. On this occasion the painting was accompanied by general discomfort, abdominal pain and fever.
At the entrance, an elevation of acute phase reactants and a typical cholestasis pattern were objectified. A thorax radiography and abdominal ultrasound were requested that were normal as well as urine sediment. Hemocultures were extracted that were positive for gram negative germs and began with adjusted antibiotic treatment according to the antibiogram.
Given the suspicion of acute cholangitis, a cholangresonance was requested that reported an anatomical variant of the cystic without being clear if such anomaly justified the clinic. The patient continued with febrile peaks and with persistently positive blood cultures for different negative germs increasingly resistant to scheduled antibiotics. During all this time, the metabolic control was very irregular, despite intravenous insulin treatment in continuous perfusion, specifying doses of insulin that oscillated between fifteen and ninety units per day and alternated prolonged hypoglycemia with episodes of cetosis hyperglycemia.
For all these reasons, it was decided to perform exploratory laparotomy with cholecystectomy whose anatomopathological study evidenced a slight inflammation of bile behaviors, being able to be in relation to a liver of sepsis or with an acute cholangitis.
After the intervention, the patient remained AFEBRIL for a week and improved metabolic control, but after this time new febrile peaks with positive blood cultures were presented. The following tests were performed, all of them without objectifying pathology: cranial, breast and thorac-abdominal, gastroscopy and colonoscopy with biopsy, gastrointestinal transit, gammography with gallium, echocardiography and ERCP.
After this, the picture was resolved spontaneously and the patient was discharged with the diagnosis of bacteremia of unloaded origin.
After three months he returns to present a new episode of ketoacidosis, this time without accompanying infectious symptoms. The patient denies insulin omission or dietary transgression. However, by downloading insulin pump data we observe several irregularities. (Bolus and Basal omission, Night Bolus Administration).
During admission, a very irregular metabolic control is once again with large variations in plasma glycemia levels, despite intensive insulin treatment, so it is decided to transfer to another reference hospital.
In this center, the patient persists with bad glycemic control alternating the episodes of ketoacidosis with deep and prolonged hypoglycemia so it is diagnosed with unstable diabetes mellitus and is performed pancreas transplantation. At 48 hours there is necessary a transplantomy, after thrombosis of the splenic vein and necrosis of the graft.
The patient is currently under treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin by infusion pump, persists with bad metabolic control (HBA1c = 10.9) and has presented three income from ketoacidosis in the last 6 months, one of them accompanied by fever and positive blood cultures for germs of oral and vaginal flora simultaneously."
"29 -year -old male who consults for fever and intense odinophage. To the tachycardic physical examination to 136 LPM, temperature 39 OC; At the cervical level, an increase in left thyroid volume was seen with palpable, fluctuating mass.

Faced with the suspicion of infectious acute thyroiditis, intravenous empirical antibiotrapy begins. In the cervical ultrasound a left thyroid abscess with reactive locorregional nodes was observed. In the neck TC, another retrophoneing collection was evidenced. In thyroid scintigraphy absence of visualization of the left heithyroid. Given these findings, the otolaryngology service is interconsulting, deciding to drain both abscesses through cervicotomy. Purulent material with abundant leukocytes was obtained isolating Streptococcus viridans, Eikenella corrodens, prevotella sp, bacteroides vulgatus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, meckia hug and peptosttptococcus micros.

Normal pondoestatural and cognitive development. Start of pubertal development over 12 years with pubarchia. No eunuchoid habit, bilateral 12 ml tests. Little facial hair (his father does have a beard). His mother refers who thought it was for the third grade burn he had as a newborn.
It does not refer to drug or anabolizing consumption. No Palatal Hendidura Type Malformations. No syndromic appearance or clinical impression of systemic inflammatory disease or chronic disease.
As a relevant family history, his mother suffers from primary hypothyroidism, a monorena sister, a premium with celiac disease and another maternal premium with neonatal hyperamonemia diagnosed in neonatal screening (currently is 13 years old and is a healthy girl).
It is requested full hormonal study where the analytical result of secondary hypogonadism is re -objectified but other hormonal alterations are observed; Hemochromatosis is ruled out in analytical study. Nuclear magnetic resonance of pituitary is requested in which no alteration is objective.
Since the full study had been carried out, the diagnosis of normosmic Kallman syndrome is raised, so genetic study of Gnrhr, KISS1R or KISS1 genetic studies is requested, currently in progress.
Initially, intramuscular testosterone cypionate is guided every 21 days and the patient refers to significant improvement in vitality, libido and volume of ejaculations. The use of gonadotrophin analogs will be raised in the event that the patient has gestational desire.
Although initially the case could seem a secondary hypogonadism acquired given the late age of its beginning there is no apparently etiological trigger known to it. Reviewing the literature, there is talk that Kallman syndrome can manifest itself late, despite not being frequent."
"The case of a patient with female assignment at birth that initially consulted at 12 years in pediatric endocrinology of another center from another center manifesting a male gender identity is presented. Study began in the following years the presence of primary amenorrhea (with absence of response to estrogen + progestogens), 46xy career and normal response to the stimulation test with 2500 IU of HCG with testosterone elevation, being cataloged by Pseudohermaphroditismo male (or morris syndrome). Subsequently they identified among the relatives: 1 sister and 2 cousins ‚Äã‚Äãalso diagnosed with masculine pseudohermaphroditism.
The patient abandoned the follow -up and at 24 he resumed him by going to gynecology with the aim of ending the study and reaffirming his male identity through sex reallge surgery. The physical examination at that time was corresponding to a female phenotype with tanner, vulva, vulva and clitoris of normal size, without palpable masses in English and vagina of normal length, with the absence of uterus and ovaries in transrotal ultrasound. In the analytics highlighted LH 24.5 MUI/mL (slightly elevated), FSH 2.3 MUI/ML, Testosterone 8.8 NMOL/L (slightly diminished), Estradiol 12 pg/ml, Progesterone 0.80 ng/ml and prolactin 149 Œºui/ml. Genetic study was carried out detecting punctual mutation of the androgen receiver gene (change of guanine cytosine in exon 2) confirming the diagnosis of Morris syndrome and was later derived to the unity of attention to transsexual people for their desire to reallocate sex through surgery where the study with abdominal-p√©lvica RM was completed visualizing bilateral cryptor.
The patient is currently waiting for bilateral gonadectomy and pending deciding the best post -guest substitute treatment with the difficulty that has a gender identity clearly felt and expressed as masculine and the intrinsic resistance to the androgens it presents."

In addition, the febrile picture is resolved and the patient has a favorable evolution of the seventic vein thrombophlebitis picture."
"We present the case of a 48 -year -old male who began with symptoms of frontalization and march disorder, being referred to the neurology service, with progressive worsening, specifying wheelchair, and alteration of behavior consisting of disinhibition, irritability, loss of sphincter control, affective indifference and apathy.

General blood analytics, serological study, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and neutrophils (ANCA) and lumbar puncture, without abnormalities were performed.
A cervical and cranial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was requested, reflecting at the medulla The hematoencephalic barrier (BHE).

Electromyography (EMG) was performed, evidencing signs of mixed polyneuropathy in lower limbs, with low sensitive amplitude data and reducing motor speeds.

Given the symmetrical affectation of white substance, a metabolic disorder was suspected, requesting tests, without objectifying alterations in the quantification of amino acids or acylcarnitines, but the elevation of very long chain fatty acids (AGCML) in blood, specifically of hexacosanoic acid (C26: 0), with a result of 2.18 micromol/liter (Œºmol/l) had as a upper limit the reference laboratory 0.17 Œºmol/L, and tetracosanoic acid (C24: 0), with levels of 47 Œºmol/l being the limit of 14 Œºmol/l.
In addition, there was an investment of the quotient of said AGCML with the Behenic acid C22: 0 (C26: 0/C22: 0 of 0.071 and C24: 0/C22: 0 of 1.54, the limits for the laboratory of 0.77 ¬± 0.12 and 0.012 ¬± 0.004 respectively), allowing to establish the diagnosis of X-ALD.
To confirm it, ABCD1 genetic study was conducted, observing delection in hechigosis in position C.1415_1416Delag giving a premature codon p.gln472argfsx83 and leading to a truncated protein with loss of 26% of their amino acids, compatible with the established diagnosis.
The patient was educated dietically and levels of testosterone and blood cortisol were determined, being normal.
The severity of this entity is more intense in hemocartos and minor men in heterozygous women. There is perixication beta oxidation deficit of the AGCML, secondarily leading to their accumulation (especially C26: 0 and C24: 0)

In the central nervous system, spinal cord, adrenal cortex and testicular tissue fundamentally. This deficit is due to mutations of the ABCD1 (XQ28) gene of the X chromosome, which cause the DDP protein dysfunction (lignoceryl-CoA synthetase), fundamental in the transport of the AGCML from the cytoplasm to the peroxisome lumen.
Phenotypic variability appears, according to neurological affectation and age of appearance:

- Cerebral: The most quickly progressive. It affects between 2.5 and 12 years, being rare in adolescents (<7%) or adults (<5%). Moderate cognitive deficit, neurosensory deafness, cerebellar ataxia, hemiplegia, subclinical primary supply, seizures and dementia appears.

- Adrenomieloneuropathy (AMN): second and fourth decade. There is spastic paraparesis with alterations of the march, sexual dysfunction and adrenal insufficiency in 2/3 of the patients.

- Addison: around 10% of patients suffer adrenal insufficiency, without brain affectation, although there is a risk of developing it4.
- Heterozygous women: 50% have slowly progressive neurological affectation. The adrenal insufficiency is rare.

The diagnosis is based on the clinic, NMR, the demure demonstration of the AGCML in serum, specifically of C26: 0 and C24: 0, and the investment of the quotient with C22: 0.
The most sensitive image test is the NMR, which shows bilateral and symmetrical affectation of the white substance at the central level. Hyperintensity is objective in T2, especially in the T√©mporo-Ocipital region and calluse bodies. According to the location of the injury, it is classified as:

1. Parietooccipital lobe and splenium of the corpus callosum. 2. Frontal lobe and knee of the corpus callosum.
3. Frontopontine and corticospinal.
4. Cerebellar.
5. Front and parietooccipital lobe combination.

The only useful treatment in the prevention of neurological progression is the transplantation of hematopoietic parents (TPH) alogenic from bone marrow, cord blood or peripheral blood. The main inconvenience lies in the morbid of the procedure. Therefore, gene therapy has been proposed, transferring the ABCD1 gene in hematopoietic fibroblasts and cells through a lentiviral vector derived from the HIV virus, although more studies are necessary to spread its application. The TPH is indicated before the appearance of new injuries, increased those already existing in the MRI, or appearance of new neurological symptoms."
"We present the case of a 16 -year -old male patient who goes to consultation for pubertal and growth delay.

family history
Father and brother with normal stature and puberty. Maternal grandfather who died by glioblastoma.
The mother consulted with gynecology in 2004 due to menstrual disorders. Pathology was discarded and discharged. In 2007, with a headache, an RM showed a hypophysical macroadenoma of 1cm, not functioning, remaining subsequently asymptomatic and with a normal pituitary axis, so it was decided to expectant attitude.

Current disease
The family refers that the patient had headache, nausea and vomiting from the age of seven. His pregnancy and childbirth were normal (birth weight: 3,150 kg, height: 50 cm)
to the exploration, weight of 51.7 kg, size of 154 cm (<P5). 2CC bag tests, pubarche 3, axillarchy 1.

complementary tests
ANALYTICS: Hemogram and biqimica without alterations, TSH 0.31ŒºUI/ml, T4L 11.7 PML/L, FSH 3.04 MUI/ML, LH 0.12 MUI/ML, testosterone 0.49 ng/ml, cortisol 60ng/ml, IGF-1 192 ng/ml. Prostectina 8649 ng/ml stands out
Exercise and clonidine test without a response from GH. Bone Age: 12 years.

evolution
In view of the results, a substitute treatment of the thyrotropic and corticropopus axes was initiated and RM of pituitary gadolinium was requested, with the finding of a pituitary mass of 47.6x22x47.2 mm that eroded the soil selar, extending in the left arrogant cistern and surrounding the carotid.

Treatment with progressively ascending dose of cabergoline began, up to a maximum tolerated dose of 1.5mg per week. After a few months there was no biochemical response, persisting high prolactin, so it was finally decided surgical treatment.

The pathological anatomy revealed that it was effectively a prolactinoma. The in vitro functional analysis showed that, although a decrease in the production of prolactin and the expression of the DRD2 receptors could be appreciated with the exposure of the piece to cabergoline, the inhibition was not total and the reduction of the cellular proliferation of the tumor was not complete. This would explain the resistance to proven treatment in vivo.

Four months after surgery in the RM, a 30x20x30 mm mass was still appreciated, remaining hypopituitarism and hyperprolactinemia (PRL 178.9 ng/ml) .1 .1 .1 .1
Substitute treatment with alpha choriogonadotropin and alpha folitropin, levothyroxine and hydrocortisone were continued. The cabergoline was maintained at a maximum tolerated dose at that time (3.5 mg weekly) and the possibility of radiotherapy was raised, being the patient pending to receive it at the present time.
Simultaneously, the patient's mother kept monitoring in our service for the hypoophysical macroadenoma previously diagnosed. During that time, the dough maintained the same volume, without invasion of the surrounding structures and with a pituitary axis without alterations.

With the diagnosis of the son's prolactinoma, and therefore the presence of pituitary adenomas in two relatives not associated with any other endocrine alteration, genetic study was requested that showed a mutation of the AIP2 gene in former 6: 974g OA (p.arg325gln), which was also found in another child, brother of our index case. The rest of the family was negative for this mutation.

evolution
During the follow -up, the mother's non -functioning pituitary macroadenoma maintained the same volume and the pituitary axis was normal.
Two years ago, in a mother's routine analysis, hypercalcemia appeared, finally confirming a hyperparathyroidism and a suggestive image of the lower right paratyroid adenoma in the gammography with Mibi. An lower right parathyroidectomy was carried out, verifying pathological anatomy of paratyroid gland adenoma.
After surgery, the intact PTH remained in a high range, with calcium in the upper limit.

After these findings, and thinking about the possibility of a multiple endocrine neoplasia, Men7,8 genetic study was requested, which was initially dismissed by the genetics service. In any case, TC TORACOABDOMINAL AND GASTROINTINAL AND PANCREATIC HORMONES were requested.

The results were normal in the two children, with the exception of the discovery of normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism in both.

In the mother the determinations were normal except for a glucagon of 267 pg/ml (vn 59-150) and a pancreatic polypeid> 200 pmol/l (vn <100)

In the abdominal CT, two pancreatic loaes of 26x41mm and 70x81mm were detected. An ongoing study was used to have images through PET with 68ga Dota-Noc. Other images of suspicion did not appear.

Given these findings, genetic study was requested again for MLPA (amplification of multiple ligandos-dependent probes), which revealed a profile compatible with a deletion in heterozygosis in the chromosomic region 11Q13, where the MEN1 gene is located, covering at least the region between the positions Chr11: 64571868-64578482, corresponding to exons 1 to 11.

This result is compatible with the clinical suspicion of endocrine neoplasia. The study was positive for both the mother and the two brothers.

With the diagnosis of non -functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the mother was intervened by means of corpoocaudal pancreatomy plus splenectomy. The pathological anatomy showed a well -differentiated TNEP (G1) multifocal (two tumors, one at the body level of 7.2 cm and another at the tail level of 4.2 cm) with mitotic index <2 mitosis by 10 fields and Ki 67 <2%. With the presence of vascular invasion but with a tumor limited to pancreas, without invading extrapancreatic tissue and with neoplasm -free resection margins, it was classified as PT2 N0 M0.
Weeks after the intervention, he presented a late complication with flanges that required surgical reintervention.
In extension studies, a suspicious axillary adenopathy was detected, which biopsied and confirmed the presence of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma PT2 N1A M0. This association is also described in literature.9
Tumorectomy and biopsy of centinel ganglion were performed, without extension signs. Currently in treatment with QT+RT+HT, in follow -up for medical oncology and radiotherapeutic oncology, with good evolution.

Current situation
The situation of the three relatives at the time of the publication of the present case, is:
- Patient case. Giant prolactinoma intervened and recurd, pending radiotherapy. Primary hyperparathyroidism with normocalcemia and expectant attitude.
- mother. Primary hyperparathyroidism intervened, in surveillance. Neuroendocrine tumor intervener with bridge obstruction episode in 2017. In QT and RT treatment for breast carcinoma, with good evolution.
- Younger son. Non -functioning hypophysarian microadenoma. Primary hyperparathyroidism with normocalcemia and expectant attitude."

"A 60 -year -old male patient consults for intense pain, decreased visual acuity and redness in a left eye of a week of evolution. Your family doctor indicates topical anti -inflammatory treatment and requests valuation by ophthalmology, the diagnosis of acute left unilateral panuveitis being made, for which it indicates treatment with prednisone 60 mg/day. Given the absence of clinical improvement, assessment by internal medicine for diagnostic study is requested.

As a pathological history, the patient had presented a picture of herpes facial zoster 15 days before the current episode, which he treated with Famciclovir, with adequate resolution. The patient was a smoker, single, with occasional risk of risk, and lived in a rural environment. In guided anamnesis highlighted dry cough of several months of evolution together with mechanical low back pain of years of evolution, hyporexia and loss of about 2 kg of weight in the previous 2 months, without referring another relevant symptomatology. In ophthalmological exploration there was very intense Tyndall phenomenon without hypopion, discrete conjunctival hyperemia and Iris rubeosis, 18 mmhg pio. In general physical examination: hemodynamic stability, AFEBRIL. Absence of pathological signs in the neck, normal temporal arteries. Roncus scattered in both hemithorax, rest of the normal ACR. Mild pain on palpation on right hypochondrium without hepatomegaly or other significant findings. Rest of normal physical examination.

The etiological study of a unilateral uveitis in this patient requires the processing of local or systemic infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. Less probable are paranoplastic diseases and it cannot be forgotten that up to 30% of uveitis (according to published series) are idiopathic. The ophthalmological evolution was torpid, highlighting progressive erythema and left orbital swelling, and increased left IDE. Likewise, the patient presented respiratory worsening, with persistent dry cough and dyspnea of ‚Äã‚Äãminimal efforts, so parentheral antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone) and ocular antihypertensive and hospital admission was established. In the differential diagnosis it was considered: primary ophthalmological infections (including viruses (herpes, HIV, CMV) and toxoplasm) and systemic (TB, LUES and others), inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, systemic vasculitis) and paraneoplastic diseases by solid (bronchopulmonary) or hematological (lymphoma).


Complementary tests:
The hemogram was normal. In the biochemistry, PCR 11 mg/ dl highlighted, the rest of the normal parameters being. Vsg 16 mm 1A h. ECA 17 U/ L. IGG CMV Serologies, Negative Viral Load, IgG VVZ Positive.Hla B51 positive. They were normal or negative: VHB serologies, HCV, toxoplasma, HIV, LUAS, Borrelia, Tuberculine Intradermorection (Mantoux with Booster), Ana, HLA B27. Abdominal ultrasound was performed, which targeted multiple hypodense lesions compatible with cysts. A thorax and abdomen tacked pseudonodular spotlights of irregular alveolar appearance of 20x17 mm and 10x19 mm in lower lobe of left lung and confirmed the ultrasound findings in liver. Given the radiological findings, it continued to study to rule out pulmonary TB and vasculitis. Interferon Gamma (IGRA) analysis was performed, which was negative, in addition to bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar washing whose microbiological study showed not microorganisms (including mycobacteria). Cytological study was also carried out, which was negative for malignant cells. Negative anchors.

Evolution:
Despite the establishment of antibiotic therapy and control of PIO, the patient worsened clinically, highlighting intense retroocular pain. An orbit tac showed Oi sclera thickening, hyperdense images in posterior pole within vitreous humor, increased retroorbital fat and punctual hemorrhage at the point of insertion of the optic nerve, as well as a doubtful image of retroorbital cellulite.

Vitrectomy was indicated to continue the diagnostic study. Vitrectomy is a technique not exempt from surgical risks, indicated to find a definitive diagnosis in patients with atypical manifestations, failure of empirical therapies or before the suspicion of the underlyplastic processic processic notching, especially in those patients with subsequent involvement of the U√∫vea. Samples were sent for an√°tomo-patological study, in which there were no significant findings, and microbiological study. After several days they informed us of the growth of Nocardia otiscaviarum. In vitreous humor resistant to imipenem, tetracyclines, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, cefotaxima and sensitive to TMP-SMX. The patient initiated treatment with TMP-SMX, achieving progressive ophthalmological and respiratory clinical improvement. After 2 months, the disappearance of ocular inflammation and liver and pulmonary inflammation was found in control image tests."
"75 -year -old male patient with HTA personal history, chronic renal failure in hemodialysis and carrier of prostheses due to abdominal aorta aneurysm. At 6 years of the implant, it has episodes of digestive hemorrhage associated with prosthetic-duodenal fistula.

18F-FDG PET/TC is requested to rule out prosthetic infection, showing an increase in periprothetic capture in the porta of abdominal aorta located between L2-L3. The journey measures about 4 cm and has a 6.7 SUVMAX on the anterior wall, which is thickened (normal Aorta SUV: 2.6), in probable relationship with infectious/inflammatory process at that level.

The posterior angio-TC is shown aneurysmatic 4 cm in diameter with a 7.7 mm high and 5.5 mm deep subrender ulcer, as well as aneurysmatic encompassing of both illuminated territories.

Vascular derivation is decided by means of axilo-bifemoral left by. In the immediate postoperative period it presents episodes of hematemesis and syncope. Emergency surgery is carried out with removal of the prosthesis and Aortoduodenal fistula section.


Therefore, the 18F-FDG PET/TC has proven to be a sensitive and useful technique in the diagnostic orientation of infectious processes in vascular prostheses."
"29 -year -old man, with a history of several autolysis attempts, who goes to the emergency room for presenting dizziness, blurred vision, liquid diarrhea, nausea, sweating and tremors, after 48 hours of having ingested an infusion of Nerium oleander.
Physical examination referred a good general condition, AFEBRIL, blood pressure 130/70 mmhg and heart rate 130 LPM. In cardiac auscultation there was a sinus tachycardia. The electrocardiogram showed a supraventricular tachycardia with negative T waves in anterolateral face. Hemogram, platelets, normal blood coagulation and biochemistry. Plasma digoxin levels were performed obtaining a result of 0.67 ng/ml. The patient was admitted and at the request of the pharmacy service, two more levels of Digoxin were performed, at 24 and 48 hours of admission, whose results were 0.6 and 0.55 ng/ml specifically. For these concentrations, an elimination semivid of 138.2 h, and a maximum theoretical plasma concentration of 0.85 ng/ml was calculated after the intake of the Adelfa infusion. At discharge, four days after admission, the patient had been with normal soft heart deposition and normal heart rate for two days."
"45 -year -old male with a history of chronic HIV infection Stadium A2 in treatment with ABC/3TC and NVP since 2011, with CD4+ 100 &/mm3 and CV HIV <20 COP/mL in its last control and chronic migraine without aura in follow -up by neurology treated with 5mg flunarizine per day and rhizatriptan 10mg in the crises. In December 2013, a 4 -day evolution table characterized by intense left migraine pain associated with retroocular and periorbital pain and ipsilateral transient ptosis, appreciating mild asymmetry in left palpebral opening, without other findings or meningeal signs, without teaching or connectival injection where brain CT without significant findings, background without evidence of eye without evidence of eye without evidence of eye without evidence without evidence of eye without evidence without evidence of eye without evidence without evidence of eye without evidence without evidence of eye Papildema and objective vsg 104 mm/h. At no time presented mandibular claudication or fever. Given the changes in the characteristics of the usual headache, admission is decided for study. The Doppler ultrasound of the temporal artery did not show pathological findings. Cerebral and orbital IRM is also normal. In the analytics, a dissociated colostasis stood out: Alkaline phosphatase 267 U/L, GGT 222 U/L Total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl GOT 18 GPT 25 U/L, so abdominal ultrasound is performed that shows a solid liver lesion in segment 4 hypoecogenic and hypovascularized, suggestive of metastatic lesion. After finding, abdominal CT is requested where it is objective in segment 4A, heterogeneous contrast, poorly delimited collection area, about 5 cm maximum diameter with presence inside several hypodense images, there may also be hypodenous foci in closeness. The lesion is not suggestive of metastasis although it cannot be ruled out and could be related to cholangiocarcinoma or even with an infectious/ inflammatory etiology. The result of serum serology is received with RPR 1/256, FTA- ABS +, AC. Total Treponema Pallidum +. Given the suspicion that headache could be in relation to a neurosyphilis, lumbar puncture is performed and treatment with penicillin g na+ IV begins, obtaining the following results: 3 lymphocytes, proteins 34 mg/dl negative vdrl, PCR t Pallidum Negative. Therefore, neurosyphilis is ruled out, initially diagnosing latent syphilis of indeterminate duration, changing the treatment to penicillin G benzatin 2.4 mu imper weekly, for 3 weeks. After the beginning of penicillin, the patient refers frank improvement of headache and the general state. Biopsy of liver lesion is requested. During the procedure it is striking that the lesion has decreased in size (12mm), so it dismisses the realization of it obtaining only by Paaf that shows mature hepatocytes without atypia. This reduction in the lesion size is accompanied by a decrease in colostasis enzymes as well as improvement during admission, so we think that the clinical-radiological picture may be all in relation to a hepatic gumatian tertiary syphilis. After completing 3 doses of G benzatina IM penicillin, in May 2014 control is performed, not visualizing any hepatic lesion, and the control analytics no longer shows cholestasic pattern (FA 88U/L, GGT 51 U/L, GOT 14, GPT 21 U/L). The control RPR is 1/8. Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema Pallidum spirochete, can imitate a variety of conditions."
"Clinical History/ Anamnesis:
79-year-old male without known medication allergies, with personal history of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, dyslipidemia, ankylosing spondylitis (EA) of 20 years of evolution in treatment with anti-TNF for 6 years, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, several episodes of AIT, an intervened vesical neoplasm. In remission in treatment with Valsartan, Lecardinipino, Atorvastatin, LansoPrazole, Metfromin, Dacortin 2.5mg/Day, Sintrom and Adalimumab 40 mg every 15 days. As a pet I had two dogs. He had not made recent trips and denied consumption of dairy products without pasteurizing. He goes to the emergency department for a fever picture of up to 38oc with chills and tyitone without a clear time predominance of a week of evolution accompanied by deterioration of the general state and glycemic decompensation. He also presented pain in left hemithorax of pleuritic characteristics and several episodes of arterial hypotension that had forced him to go several times to the emergency service the previous days. He did not present respiratory, gastrointestinal or mionic companion clinic.

Physical examination
NORMOTENSE AND TACHICARD TO 120 LATHROOM PER MINUTES. 98% basal oxygen saturation. T 38.3o. Bad general condition, sweaty with distal skin. Eupleic at rest. Without adenopathies to peripheral palpation or jugular ingurgitation. Arhyrmic tones with multifocal systolic breath II/IV. Generalized hypoventilation. Abdomen and lower limbs without significant findings. No neurological focus or meningeal signs.

Income diagnosis
Febril syndrome without focus and pancitopenia under study

Routine complementary tests
During your stay in plant there is a rapid progressive decrease of the three series (acute pancitopenia), presenting HB: 8.1 g/dl, platelets: 63x109L; Leukocytes: 1,760x109L together with maximum LDH elevation of 981 U/L and minimum bilirubin increase at the expense of indirect and descent of haptoglobin, as well as increased ferritin (peak of 4383 ng/ml) and triglycerides 550 mg/dl

The analytical study is completed with autoimmunity (ANA, ANCA, ANTI DNA, ENA, antimitation antibodies, smooth and antiphospholipid anti -muscle) that is negative, proteinogram with doubtful gamma monoclonal component that subsequently confirmed the absence of monoclonal band by immunolectrophoresis. Mantoux and Quantiferon negative. Legionella, Pneumococcus and Leishmania antigen in negative urine. Lowestein culture in negative urine. Hepatic and Brucella serology, Salmonella Typhi and Parathyphi, Ricketsia Coronii, Coxiella Burneti, CMV, VHS, VEB and Parvovirus B19 negative. HIV negative. Negative hemo and uroculture. In the image tests, abdominal ultrasound is performed that shows bilateral pleural effusion and hepatoesplenomegaly. In thorax TC, pleural calcifications, calcified liver granulomas and some calcified adenopathies as well as bilateral pleural spill with underlying lung collapse are objective. Transtoracic and transesophage echocardiography: negative for endocarditis. Finally, a bone marrow-aspiopsy (MO) is performed in which the flow cytometry has a presence of 0.1% of immature myeloid lineage cells without phenotypic aberrances, it is not observed Lymphoid b monoclonal Population Lymphal Population T with CD4/CD8 ratio maintained. The myelogram was not conclusive due to lumps and little cell phone, although no blast were observed. The culture for Brucella and mycobacteria is negative. In this biopsy in the pathological anatomy, amastigote parasites compatible with Leishmania were observed later confirming with PCR technique for Leishmania.

Differential diagnosis
Pancitopenia is defined as the decrease in the normal figure in leukocyte blood (<4.5x109/L), hemoglobin according to age and sex and platelets (<150.0x109/L). Given these findings, it is necessary to perform a differential diagnostic algorithm between which must be included mainly onco-hematological, autoimmune or infectious. Within the hematological causes we should mainly discard neoplasms such as acute leukemia or bone marrow lymphomas without forgetting the remote metastases of other solid tumors. Other hematological causes to highlight are myelodysplastic syndromes, MO aplasia, myelofibrosis, tricholeucemia, myloptis, megaloblastic anemia and nocturnal paroxysmal hemoglobinuria. In general, it will be necessary to carry out MO aspirate-biopsy for the diagnosis of these entities. One of the main causes of autoimmune origin that can cause pancitopenia is systemic lupus erythematosus (among its diagnostic criteria are anemia, leukopenia and thrombopenia) and less frequently rheumatoid arthritis. There are numerous causes of infectious origin that are with cytopenias. For the diagnosis of these, in addition to the serological determinations and specific tests of any of them in the laboratory, the realization of a correct anamnesis that includes information about recent trips, place of origin and place of habitual housing, job position, contact with animals, type of food, etc. will be of great importance, etc. Among the causes of infectious origin, we must highlight mainly mycobacteria (tuberculosis), brucellosis, parasites such as Leishmania, virus (HIV, VHA, VHB, VHC, VEB, CMV and PARVOVIRUS B19) and bacterial sepsis (more frequent non -frequent cause of pancitopenia in the occipital world). In addition to these three distinct groups of causes of pancithopenia, we could include a fourth group where we would find a miscellaneous causes that we cannot include in the previous classification. Among them we highlight drugs such as some immunosuppressants, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, etc., chemotherapy and radiotherapy, hemophagocytic syndrome and sarcoidosis.

Definitive clinical judgment
Hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to Leishmania infection in patient with ankylosing spondylitis treated with anti-TNFŒ±.

Evolution
Given the initial suspicion of hemophagocytic syndrome, corticoid treatment was initiated at high doses and immusup by cyclosporin with stabilization of the three hematological series and discreet descent from ferritin and analytical data of hemophagocytosis. Subsequently, when confirming the diagnosis of leishmaniasis, the patient began treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, presenting rapid clinical and analytical response, disappearing pancitopenia and governing ferritin in about 2 weeks. During his follow -up in consultation the patient has remained asymptomatic, with steroids in slow descent. After 1 year of follow -up with dose of prednisone 7 ""5 mg a day presents hemogram and ferritin within normality."
"38 -year -old woman, not smoker or drinking man, with a history of migraine headache, and a single comical crisis in 2005 studied. Diagnosed 10 days before: Multiple myeloma Benze-Jones Lambda Stadium IIia, associated with renal function impairment as the first clinical manifestation: myeloma kidney, which required realization of renal biopsy, and start of induction treatment to chemotherapy with dexamethasone bowling I.V. The patient consulted for intense holocraneal headache, asthenia, vomiting, fever of up to 39oc, paraesthesia on the left shoulder, and commented inability to remember in the short term. The physical examination highlighted an alteration of the superior functions, with Bradipsiquia, alteration of short -term memory, emotional lability, nominative aphasia, neck stiffness, but with Kerning and Bruzinsky negative. It was requested: Plant analytics with hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl, leukocytosis, creatinine 1.87mg/dl, normal rest. In the urine sediment, Piuria is due to which empirical treatment with ceftriaxone began. Hemoculture and urine culture were extracted without microbiological insulation. With normal thorax and abdomen radiography. Given the clinic, it was requested TC-Cranial without contrast with normal result, and non-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid lumbar puncture (LCR) (leukocytes 1342/mm3; polymorphonuclear: 3.1%; mononuclear 97%, hematies 1000/mm3; ada, glucose and normal protein), together with cultivation of CSF; Serology for VHS, HIV, CMV, Toxoplasma.

Results
Given the patient's clinic and the analysis of the CSF compatible with probable viral encephalitis vs beheaded bacterial, empirical treatment was initiated with acyclovir IV adjusted to renal function, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin. The crops, Gram staining, HIV serologies, CMV, toxoplasma were negative. The IGG serology for VHS was positive. Magnetic cerebral resonance with contrast (RMC) was requested in which it was objectified: Extensive hyperintensus subcortical cortical lesion in the left anterior temporary, insula, hippocampus and basal ganglia with masses effect and mild effects of the 3-4mm midline, and hemorrhagic necrotic component inside, and slight right temporal affectation. PCR of Enterovirus, Herpes Simple Virus (VHS), Virus Vicela Zoster, Citomegalovirus, with positive result for VHS-1, was requested.

Final diagnosis
Left temporal herpetic encephalitis with discreet right affectation."
"75 -year -old woman who entered our hospital by ataxia picture and cognitive alterations of 2 months of evolution, accompanied by epileptic crises in the last 24 h. His relatives denied fever or headache. As a personal history, it presented well -controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. Its usual treatment included 50 mcg levothoxin, enalapril 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg and metformin 2 gr a day. On physical examination he presented stupor, he was AFEBRIL and Normotensa with a Glasgow of 11 (6-3-2), generalized hypertonia, myoclonic and nystagmus movements. The reflexes were present and presented Babinsky Izquierdo. He had no meningeal signs. Cardiorespiratory auscultation and the rest of the exploration did not provide significant findings. The analytics showed a normal globular sedimentation rate. The liver, renal and thyroid function as well as the ionogram, proteinogram, vitamin B levels and folic acid, RPR and venous gasometry were also normal. Tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein alpha antiginembronic antigen-CAS 19.9, 125, 15.3 and neurospecific inolase) calcitonin and beta-HCG were significant. With respect to the autoimmune study (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antigens, anti pr3, anti mpo, anti ro and anti la, antimicrosomales, anticardiolipin and antiperoxidase were normal as well as the levels of ECA, cryoglobulins and cryoaglutinins. The serology for HIV, HBB, HCV, RICKETTSIA, Borrelia, Borrelia, Borrelia, Borrelia Mycoplasma, Coxiella, Brucella, Adenovirus, Echovirus and VHS Type II were negative. The EEG objectified a diffuse slowdown with alternating theta-of the alterous without specific focalings or irritative paroxysm. Pneumococus were irrelevant. The study was expanded requesting aminolevulin, porphobilinogen, lead and arsenic delta acids in 24 h urine, legionella antigenuria, cortisol, ceruloplasmin and paraneoplastic encephalitis antibodies (anti-hu, anti amphifisin and anti ma-2) with negative result. A second lumbar puncture showed identical biochemical and microbiological parameters and anas, Ig G against Borrelia, immunoglobulin and quantification of bands and PCR for JC viruses and negative tropherima whipplei. Both the PCR for VHS type I and Harrington test (determination of the prion protein 14-3-3 by immunoblot and colorimetry) were positive. Antiviral treatment was initiated with acyclovir that was replaced by hook by transient acute tubular necrosis. After 3 weeks of treatment there was no clinical response, persisting stupor, with generalized pyramidalism, nystagmus and myoclonia. A second cerebral RM, performed 10 weeks after the beginning of the symptomatology was normal again. The result of the polymorphism of codon 129 was received in CSF, showing homozygosity for the methodin (129 m/m), information compatible with the sporadic variant of the ECJ. A cerebral biopsy was performed that confirmed neuronal loss and spongiform degeneration with vacuolization and multiple PRP deposits in immunohistochemistry. No signs of herpetic encephalitis and the PCR of the VHS-I were observed in the cerebral biopsy was negative. The patient died 3 months after the start of the symptomatology. The autopsy was rejected."
"50 -year -old male who consults at the Emergency Gate for presenting, for a month, hemopthoic expectoration that in the last 15 days was accompanied by pain on the left side of pleuritic characteristics, without fever, without distress, without constitutional syndrome or other accompanying symptomatology. Among his personal history, he stood out: worker in the field, a 60-pack/ year exfuster for a year and a half, with a stable partner for 6-7 years. A year before he was diagnosed with right basal pneumonia that resolved with antibiotic treatment at an outpatient level. His physical examination evidenced a good general condition, being conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest. It presented adenopathies supplies left of an approximate diameter of 1 cm, painless, not attached. To pulmonary auscultation presented rhythmic tones without blows., With generalized decrease in vesicular murmur at the pulmonary level. Soft abdomen, depressible, without masses or palpable visceromegalias; and lower limbs without edema. During their emergency stay, urgent analytics are carried out in which PCR stood out: 107.4 mg/l and a D 3.52 dimer. AG. Legionella/Pneumococcus in urine that was negative; as well as sputum cultivation. It was requested in turn, chest radiography P with the following result: condensation vs dough in lympula with left pleural spill

Given the clinic and the findings in the tests, admission is decided in the internal medicine plant for lung mass study. During his plant stay the patient remains hemodynamically stable, shaving and, continuing with scarce hemptoic sputum. Pulmonary mass study begins by considering the following differential diagnoses. Given his antecedents of important smoker, the first thing to rule out was a pulmonary neoplasm; Due to the element of the D and the characteristics of the mass, the presence of a pulmonary thromboembolism was assessed and the pulmonary infarction with it; and finally the infectious etiology of the mass. To start with the study, complete analytical analytics was requested with tumor markers (specific CEA and neuronal inolase) and thyroid hormones that were normal, requesting serology of tuberculosis, VHA, VHB, HCB, HCV, toxoplasma, cytomeglaovirus and HIV. Waiting for results, the study continued with a diagnostic thoracocent√©sis with the result of exudate, being sent sample for microbiology and pathological anatomy; In Broncoscopy, erythematous zone was objectified around the entrance of the bronchio of the right upper lobe, which in turn obtained samples for pathological anatomy and microbiology. Through pulmonary arteries angio-tac, thromboembolism was ruled out at that level and in TACO-ABDOMINO-PELVIC TAC, the following result was obtained.

After this, the results of the serologies were obtained: Mantoux, Vha VHB, HCV, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasma were negative; However, it was obtained positive for HIV. In the sample of thoracentesis and bronchoscopy sent to analyze, anatomy pathology did not observe suggestive cells of neoplasia; However, it was isolated, by microbiology, in both Rhodocuccus Equi, with abundant colonies, present in turn in sputum sample. After the findings, analytics are requested to determine HIV stadium with the following results: HIV viral load: 95573 COP/ml. T lymphocits. CD3+ CD4+ Absolute: 225 Cell/MCRL. CD4/CD8 quotient: 0.17 HLA-B*27.*35. Study of HIV resistances to retroviral drugs: without phenotypic resistances. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with: - Complicated pneumonia with left pleural effusion by Rhodococcus equi. -Infect HIV Stadium B2. Antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, rifampicin and intravenous azithromycin begins, in turn starting antiretroviral treatment with atry. Given the low clinical response and the persistence of radiological infiltrate and the elevation of acute phase reactants is suspended vancomycin and treatment with imipenem begins maintaining the intravenous antibiotic pattern for two weeks, presenting a favorable clinical evolution. At the discharge, the patient maintains treatment with rifampicin and azithromycin for 6 months, with symptomatology resolution and radiological improvement."
"42-year-old woman who consults for the third time in emergencies for presenting fever of up to 38-5oc fluctuating, without clear morning or evening predominance, for 17 days, preceded by abdominal pain of one month of evolution of location in mesogastrium and epigastrium with increased intestinal habit for several months, presenting diarrheal depositions with mucus, as well as arthralgia. 10 days before had started treatment with levofloxacin without presenting improvement. Among his background stood out ex-foamer of 19 packages/year for 8 years, History of sinusitis, extrinsic rhinitis-asma by p√≥lenes awareness. In January 2013, it requires admission to internal medicine due to lower left lobe pneumonia acquired in the community with a minimum associated pleural effusion, with peripheral eosinophilia that is maintained until the moment of this consultation. To physical examination, pain to the deep palpation of Mesogastriom without signs of peritoneal irritation, rest of anodine exploration, highlighted pain. During your emergency stay, urgent analytics are requested in which a PCR 111.2 mg/l stood; Eosinophilia of 1,200 (18.5%), so they enter internal medicine silver such as fever to study and eosinophilia. Upon arrival at Planta, the patient continues with febrile peaks, abdominal pain and diarrhea starting with asthmatic decompensation. Complete plant analytics were requested, in which 6200 (50.4%), high PCR of 108.7 mg/l, rheumatoid factor of 591.8 IU/ml, tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, Ca 125, Ca 15.3; Ca19.9; CEA) with Ca 125 high 193.7 U/ml; Autoimmunity with Anas, ENAS, ANCAS and AC. Antiphospholipid that were normal, as well as serology of Salmonella, Brucella, Coxiella Burnetii; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Rickettsia Conorii All of them negative. Given the personal history of the patient, the clinic and the analytical findings, the following differential diagnoses were raised: parasitic infection; Hematological disease such as eosinophilic syndrome, lymphoma (Hodking, no Hodking), leukemia or mastocytosis; Gastrointestinal disease such as eosinophilic gastroenteritis and Churg-Strauss disease. To continue the study, IGE determination is requested that was 325, peripheral blood smear that objectified absolute eosinophilia, without observing atypical cells; Store is carried out that ruled out the presence of parasites. Simultaneously, TAC of breasts-TERAX-ABDOMEN are requested that found sympaty, small pericardial spill, left pleural spill with lower lobe atelectasis and colitis with moderate amount of abdominal free fluid. And to complete study, invasive tests such as palacesis, gastro-collansocpia, and nasofibroscopy were performed, of which samples were obtained for both microbiology and pathological anatomy. While the study was carried out, the patient began treatment with corticotherapy and antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone with improvement of the digestive clinic and pleural effusion. The results of microbiology were obtained that ruled out the presence of pathogen in the samples received; However, pathological anatomy confirms the presence of eosinophils in all sample received. With the results, from the differential diagnoses that were raised, the presence of parasitosis, hematological disease. The presence of an eosisnophilic gastroenteritis that added to the patient's personal history made the diagnosis of Churg Strauss disease, which according to the criteria of the ACR:
¬∑ Asthma.
¬∑ Eosinophilia greater than 10% in the differential count of white blood cells.
¬∑ Development of mono- polyneuropathy or multiple mononeuropathy (glove/sock distribution) attributable to systemic vasculitis.
¬∑ Migratory or transient pulmonary infiltrates in RX (not including fixed infiltrates) attributable to systemic vasculitis.
¬∑ Paranasal sinus abnormality: History of acute or chronic paranasal pain or hypersensitivity to the radiological tact or opacification of paranasal sinuses.
Extravascular eosinophilia. Biopsy including arteries, arterioles or v√©nulas that show accumulation of eosinophils in extravascular areas.
¬∑ Of which the patient met 5 of the 6 criteria, so after the clinical improvement the patient is discharged with the following diagnosis:
¬∑ Churg-Strauss disease in the eosinophilic phase.

"79-year-old man, exfuster from the age of 70 (total 30 package) who consults for a month of evolution. As a pathological history, there is allergy to penicillin, hypertensive without vascular complications, chronic non -acute bronchitis and benign prostate hyperplasia. In habitual treatment with Plusvent Acuhaler 50/500 mcg 1 inh every 12h, amlodipine 5m every 24h, doxazosin 4mg 1 Comp every 24h. The clinical picture begins on 09.07.13 When he consults at the Reference Hospital for Right Sacred Lumbo Pain with exploratory maneuvers suggestive of sacroilitis, so infiltration was performed, giving the pain. Reconsults on 23.07.13 in the same center due to 8 -day fever of evolution with chills, accompanied by dysuria, sporadic vomiting of food content and some episode of diarrhea without pathological products. Hemogram was performed that did not show leukocytosis, negative urinary sediment, being valued as enteroinvasive gastroenteritis, treatment with 500 mg ciprofloxacin was paid for 500 mg every 12h for 10 days. Consult on 12.08.13 in our center for persistence of high fever of up to 39oc, daily and evening predominance, accompanied by profuse sweating, which is punctually accompanied by episodes of Franca Tyriton every 24-48h accompanied by cough with scarce expectoration and resolution of the digestive clinic. As an epidemiological history, a trip to the province of Badajoz 7 days before the consultation. The physical examination highlighted a temperature of 38.1oc, minimal wound healing in the pretibial region of the right leg without inflammatory signs, without stigmas of infectious endocarditis without other relevant findings. Analytical is performed in which it highlights elevation of acute phase reactants and normocromic normocytic anemia without evidence of hemolysis that is oriented as secondary to the base inflammatory process. Lumbar puncture is performed that evidences CSF of clear appearance with lymphocyte pleocytosis, mild proteinorrachia and normal glucorrachia. Serologies of germs causing mononucleosic syndromes are requested (HIV Neg, toxoplasma IgG+/IGM-, EBV IgG+/IGM-, CMV IgG+/IGM+), Burgdorferi IgM+/positive IgG/IgG/positive igg, sprinkler pink, quantifer√≥n, leptospira, coxiella and negative richthesia. A TC TORACOABDOMINAL ruled out intrabdominal abscesses, organomegalias or pathological adenopathies. The transtoracic echocardiogram ruled out the presence of vegetation. Anas 1/320. Before the suspicion of borreliosis type recurrent fever endemic by ticks based on epidemiology, compatible clinic and positive IgM serology for Borrelia Burgdorferi. Positive serology for CMV is oriented as possible reactivation of chronic latent infection by relative immunosuppression in context of subacute infection by Borrelia. However, in the absence of compatible clinic and the existence of a more plausible alternative cause that justifies the picture, it is not considered a tributary to antiviral treatment. Finally, the presence of Hispanic Borrelia by PCR is confirmed. The patient began treatment with doxycycline at doses of 100mg/12h, with good tolerance (especially non-clinical suggestive reaction of Jarish-Herxheimer) leaving Apiratic in less than 12 hours. It remained AFEBRIL and with progressive improvement of the general state and analytical resolution."
"41 -year -old woman, natural the southern part of Ecuador, daughter of carnicer parents, resides in Spain since 1998, without recent trips to her country of origin and without medical history. He went on different occasions for 10 months for recurring episodes of cervicalgia, headache in the occipital region, fever of up to 38.5oc, nausea and vomiting. The cervicalgia was pulsatile and intense, it was accentuated when joining and the head bending; Progressively notice legs in the legs and less strength in the hands when manipulating objects. The physical examination highlights pain to the posterior cervical palpation, without meningeal signs, although a slight resistance due to cervical flexion, minimal distal weakness to the pressure of hands, generalized hyperreflexia of predominance in lower limbs and right clonus. Normal eye bottom. A brain magnetic resonance (RMC) that showed signal hyperintensity in the diffusion study, located in the Occipital Parasagital left region was carried out. Given the suspicion of cervical myelopathy with possible migraine status, admission is decided for study. Multiple complementary tests are performed, highlighting a serology for Burgdorferii (positive IgG). The RMC is repeated, where the hyperintensity zone persisted, also including periventricular substance and a dilation of the ventricular system. Normal cervical vertebral study. The computed thorax, abdomen and pelvis axial tomography was normal. Lumbar puncture is performed, obtaining Normotense, of course, glucose 49mg/dl, proteins 63.2mg/dl, leukocytes 69 cel/ul (pmn 15%, mn 85%), red blood cells 21 cel/ul, albumin 43.6 mg/dl; Ziehl, Gram and AG staining negative cryptococcus; negative crops; CYCOLOGY OF THE CSF Sams mature lymphoid cells without atypia. The patient gets worse and new RMC shows signs of hydrocephalus and contrast collection by the meninges. Given the clinical suspicion of chronic meningitis with progressive hydrocephalus and signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, neurosurgical intervention is decided: initially implementation of ventricle-peritoneal derivation (DVP) and biopsy taking, despite this, persists clinical worsening is made (refractory headache, nausea, nausea Nystagmus), so reintervention is decided in the face of suspected DVP dysfunction, placing an external ventricular derivation (DVE) for a week, with new intervention for placement of new DVP and withdrawal from the previous DVP. Anatomopathological result is obtained, where significant pathology was not appreciated. New RMC is performed that shows an improvement, which is found with a clinical improvement and is raised as a diagnosis of chronic meningitis by possible neurosarcoidosis with secondary progressive hydrocephalus and decides to initiate steroid treatment. In one of the physical explorations, right supraclavicular swelling can be seen and redness in the posterior cervical region that did not exist before: the TAC does not show alterations. New lumbar puncture is performed, obtaining CSF with a mild pleocytosis. After these findings it is concluded that there are no signs of infection but of recurrence due to decrease in corticoid treatment and it is recommended to suspend antibiotic and increase corticosteroids. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis and other possible, since it presents a converter of normal angiotensin and quantiferon negative. Another RMC is performed, which shows contrast collection in the Paqui and Leptomeninge of the posterior face of the bulbomedular transition until the end of the second cervical vertebra along with the appearance of a liquid cyst at the level of C3, of the left pontocerebeloso angle and backward and backlocked and it is proposed that the cysts are aracnoid postmeningitis. The cervicalgia associated with vomiting persists, so new RMC is performed, appreciating midline centered and objectifying the presence of two cystic semiology lesions inside the left lateral ventricle, with the end of the catheter located in the third ventricle and persists cystic image at the left powdrive angle From the cystic lesion to the height of the vertebra C3. Subsequently, it begins to present changes to the behavior and alteration of the march; He suffers a fall in the street with TCE, presents trembling hands, difficulty walking, vomiting more frequently, urinary incontinence, no fever. Hydrocephalus is re -objectified and reintervention is decided against dvp dysfunction. Subsequently, it presents multiple complications with persistence of headache and march instability. Cure with several DVP obstruction episodes that require surgical reinterventions. The physical examination was evolutionarily appreciated of the level of the general state, without neurological focus, broad support base, face and neck edematization, cushingoid facies, tremor in both hands, despite having decreasing corticosteroids. The possibility of reactivation of its chronic meningitis after interruption of corticoid treatment is postulated. Finally, given the clinic and the findings, a new cerebral biopsy is decided by suspicion of sneaking hydrocephalus secondary to probable chronic-neurosarcoidosis meningitis. During the surgical intervention the output of multiple cysts at the subarachnoid and infracerebelar level can be seen. The pathological anatomy was informed as a piece of cystctomy in Magna Cistern: Festoneado cyst and fibrous wall of parasitic origin, although it cannot be confirmed by the absence of the parasite, a cysticercosis is the most congruent. Multiple microbiological studies are performed with biopsy, being negative for tuberculosis, fungi, amoebas. Finally, the PCR of Taenia Solium in cerebral biopsy is positive, so it is decided to start treatment with Praziquantel and Albendazole, given the diagnostic confirmation of neurocysticercosis. Unfortunately, the patient continues with bad evolution and even with episodes of DVP obstruction, which have led her to present multiple complications in relation to prolonged income. This case highlights the importance of this type of pathology and the relevance of highlighting the epidemiological background of patients, which often forget and makes us direct the diagnostic process based on pathologies that we see in our area much more frequently."
"58 -year -old male, without known medication allergies, intervened in 1985 by lumbar, appenderectomized and intervened left -eager discopathy in 2012, without medical history of interest or habitual treatment. He was on vacation in Ibiza, where he was natural, with a habitual residence in the Dominican Republic for 8 years. Consult in emergencies for general discomfort of 4 days of evolution initiated after the landing upon arrival in Spain, the next day the distress, very painful generalized arthralgia begins with little response to anti -inflammatories, asthenia, anorexia, dizziness and occasional blurred vision. Upon arrival he presented TA 148/89 mmHg, FC 110 LPM, T 38.8 OC and 97% oxygen saturation breathing ambient air. The exploration highlighted regular general status, normohydrate, normocolored and eupneic at rest with good distal perfusion. Functional impotence of predominance on both shoulders, right doll and outer face of the left ankle, with great limitation of gross in both hands. No signs of arthritis. Non -Exanthema. Cardiorespiratory auscultation and abdomen without findings. Exploration of normal cranial pairs, isocoric pupils normorreactive, without dysmetr√≠as or alterations of sensitivity, with great sense of instability to standstation. In the analytics it presented hemogram, renal function, transaminases, normal venous lactate and gasometry, PCR 4.16, other normal parameters. Basic normal urine study. Normal thorax and abdomen radiography. ECG in sinus rhythm, without blocking image or other acute alterations of repolarization. Before invalidating arthralgia with fever on the return of epidemic zone for Chikungunya fever the diagnosis of suspicion from the first moment was this. After the first complementary income tests, thick drop and antigen P Falciparum is requested for discarding malaria, in addition to dengue serologies, chikungunya, HIV, HBB, syphilis and blood cultures. Waiting for results, the patient was treated only with NSAIDs for fever and pain control. The third day of income begins vomiting with blood remains, then begins with rectorrhagia (up to 7 depositions) together with dizziness and descent of hemoglobin of 14.9 gr/dl at 12.1 gr/dl. UCI Endoscopy is performed in the ICU given the evolution of more than 24 hours with high digestive hemorrhage where it is objective: hematic remains of red blood of probable duodenal origin, unique duodenal ulcer of 1 cm in postbulbar zone, anterior-surveyal face, visible vessel without active bleeding IIA. Adrenaline is injected into the periulcerous zone and 4 hemostasis clips are placed. Given the objectified lesion with a risk of reshasing, it remains admitted for monitoring, with good subsequent evolution. Control endoscopy discards signs of bleeding. Once in the plant, just over 24 hours of the first endoscopy, it evolves satisfactorily with partial control of pain without gastolesive NSAIDs (Paracetamol 1g EV every 8 hours altering with 2g metamizol every 8 hours) and maintaining occasional fever. At the time of discharge negative serologies for HIV, HBV and syphilis, in addition to study of malaria and negative blood cultures, pending rest of the results in follow -up due to external consultations of infectious diseases of internal medicine. Recommended treatment for pain control with alternated paracetamol with Metamizol, together with H. pylori's herradic therapy. Serology would confirm a few weeks later the diagnosis of Chikungunya fever, with negativity for dengue disease."
"We present the case of a 37-year-old woman, with the only clinical history of anxious-depressive syndrome in treatment with Lorazepan and Fluoxetine, who consults in the emergency room for the appearance, a week after suffering a tonsil process manifested with odinophage and treated with antibiotia by her primary care doctor, of sensation of numbness in the left hemicurp march. Given this symptomatology, a cranial CT which is normal is performed, proceeding to the patient's discharge. But at home there is a progressive worsening of the painting, with a feeling of generalized numbness, inability to train and diplopia, so it is admitted to the hospitalization plant. After 24 hours of income, it continues to get worse, with an appearance of intense drowsiness, disorientation, bilateral ophthalmoparesia (with ptosis and limitation of all ocular movements) and tetraparesia of crural predominance, with bilateral Babinski; Given this situation, the patient is transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, reaching orotracheal intubation.

"Personal history
29-year-old male patient, without known medication allergies or medical-surgical history of interest.

Before epidemiological
Born in India, he has reside in Angola for 15 years and makes frequent trips to Hong Kong for work reasons.

Current disease
He goes to the emergency department of a Spanish hospital, because while he made with his wife a cruise through Greece and T√ºrkiye, the 8th day of travel, began with fever, jaundice, abdominal pain and diarrhea without pathological products. He went to a medical center in T√ºrkiye, where they perform an analytics in which Got 132 U/L is observed; GPT 244 U/L; GGT 199 U/L, negative VHB and VHC serology, thick drop and negative smear. 3 days later, on the 12th of cruise, once it is finished, it continues with it to the clinical picture. He had previously been 20 days ago in Hong Kong and during the 7 days prior to the trip in Angola.

Physical examination and complementary tests
In the Emergencies, it presents fever (39), TA 93/54 mmHg, FC 93lpm, and on physical examination presents hepatomegaly of 2 crossings, without other significant alterations. An analytical is performed, which highlights 18000 platelets, creatinine 1.74 mg/dl, total bilirubin 12.14 mg/dl (direct bilirubin 8.63 mg/dl, indirect bilirubin 3.51mg/dl), Got 141 U/L, GPT 163 U/L. ECG and thorax radiography without significant alterations, in abdominal ultrasound it presents discreet hepatomegaly. The rapid diagnosis test of malaria is repeated, which is positive, smear and thick drop with 17 %parasitemia.

Evolution during admission
It is diagnosed with serious malaria, presenting as criteria of poor prognosis hyperparasitemia, jaundice/transaminage and thrombocytopenia. Income in the UVI is made and treatment with artsunate I.V. For 3 days during your stay in the UVI, subsequently, with the recovery of renal function, thrombocytopenia, orally tolerance and hemodynamic stability, the transfer to a conventional hospitalization plant is decided, continuing the treatment with artamether- Lummefantrina (Riamt), 4 tablets every 12 hours for 3 days. During the following days hemodynamic stability, progressive decrease in fever and transaminases. On the +7 day of admission, it makes a feverish peak (38.7oc) again, and in the analytical control that is performed, a 10.7 mg/dl hemoglobin (at the entrance 12.2mg/dl) and LDH of 1157 U/L (at income 570 u/l) is observed. During the subsequent days he continued with fever, decrease in hemoglobin and elevation of the LDH, reaching hemoglobin Nadir (8.3 mg/dl) and elevation of LDH 1582 U/L. Hemolytic anemia was studied, performing the following complementary tests:
¬∑ Hemolysis Study: Reticulocyte elevation, Decreased HB, LDH elevation, normal haptoglobin and ferrocinic study within the limits of normality.
¬∑ Autoimmunity: ANAS and cryoglobulins within the limits of normality.
¬∑ Negative coombs
There is no G6PD deficiency
¬∑ Immunophenotype within the limits of normality.
¬∑ Colangioresonance: without significant alterations
¬∑ Without changes in the clinical attitude, 13 days later it presented hemoglobin figures 10.2 mg/dl, LDH 647 U/L, Total Bilirubin 2.91mg/dl with normalization of transaminases, so it was decided hospital registration at home with subsequent follow -up in external consultations.

Clinical judgment
Severe malaria. Hemolytic anemia secondary to articunate treatment. Good posterior clinical evolution until normalization of the different analytical parameters."

Given the results obtained, antiretroviral treatment (TARV) with Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir (200mg/ 245mg; 1-0-0) associated with Raltegravir (400mg; 1-0-1) is initiated. In addition, sulfamethoxazole/ trimetoprim (800/160 mg) is prophylactic a tablet three days a week and fluconazole (100mg; 1-0-0) for a week. Likewise, given the evidence of positive serology for syphilis, Penicillin G benzatina 2.4 Mu via im a weekly dose up to a total of three doses. At that time, the tropical medicine unit is consulted who recommend treatment with ivermectin that the patient rejects before polymedication. In April, after a month of having started the TV, the patient consults for pruriginous rash of 48 hours of predominance of trunk. Analytical is performed in which all parameters of the hemogram and biochemistry are within the normality ranges. It presents a 1.7 log CV and total CD4 count of 220/mm3 (10%). Prophylaxis with sulfametoxazole/trimetoprim and antihistamines are suspended. That same day he goes to cardiology review who withdraw ivabradina. After two weeks of symptomatic treatment, skin lesions disappear after two weeks. In May, the patient again consults for abrupt appearance of papulous, erythematous and pruriginous injuries, with a tendency to converge, that disappear to digititress and that affect English, buttocks, dorsal region and upper and lower limbs. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are respected and denies the taking of new drugs, food or risk substances. He is not in contact with domestic animals. It is treated with methylprednisolone 40 mg im a single dose and hydroxycin, with complete disappearance of the lesions in 24 hours.

In the extracted urgent analytics, eosinophils of 160/Œºl stand out and persistence of transaminase elevation (ALT 76 IU/L, AST 59 IU/L). The urine study is normal and thorax x -ray is repeated in which they observe multiple pulmonary pseudine that were not displayed in the previous exploration. Given the radiographic findings, study with thorax TC is expanded in which the presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules suggesting of an inflammatory nature vs. is confirmed. Infectious.

At this time the patient is asymptomatic from the respiratory and gastrointestinal point of view. It is decided to maintain the same TARV, start ivermectin and continue study requesting the following tests. Sputum study:
Ziehl-Auramine staining: absence of Baar.
Cultivation of regional mycobacteria and fungi: negative.
Serology for Aspergillus, cryptococcal antigen, histoplasma, coccidoidoides, paracycidioides, and blastomyces: negative. Long incubation blood cultures: negative. New PPD and PCR tuberculosis: negative. Strongyloides IgG Serology (Elisa): positive. RX of control thorax at 10 days: bilateral pseudonodular opacities that have decreased both in number and size and are less clear with respect to the previous study.

Evolution
It is a patient with late HIV infection, Na√Øve and who presents subacute diarrhea with posterior appearance of cutaneous rash. HIV infection: It presents a viral load of 5 log and a CD4+ recolement around 10%. Therefore, it is decided to start the TV previously referred to according to the indications of the Gesida consensus document and considering the rest of the patient's medication, so that it is a pattern without pharmacological interactions. The viral load after a month of treatment is practically undetectable. Subacute diarrhea: During the monitoring in consultation it refers discreet transitory improvement regarding the consistency of the feces. Among the possible causes of diarrhea in the HIV patient, that produced by bacteria, parasites, viruses and neoplasms should be ruled out. Therefore, serological and feces exhaustive study is carried out, discarding infection by the main pathogens.

In the case that occurs here, endoscopic study could not be carried out due to the patient's explicit negative. Cutaneous rash: The most important thing in the etiological diagnosis of rash is to rule out that it is an opportunistic infectious process or a pharmacological reaction. Regarding opportunistic infection, this is discarded after the results obtained in the complementary study. Likewise, it does not seem likely to be a secondary process to the taking of drugs because in anamnesis there is no temporary sequence between the introduction or withdrawal of them. In addition, study of possible pharmacological interactions is also carried out being also dismissed as possible etiology. Finally, it could be a cutaneous picture in the context of the immune reconstitution process, although it is true that the rash associated with this process usually does not present urticariform characteristics. Pulmonary nodules: given their evidence, it is essential to rule out tumor pathology. The patient described here does not present constitutional clinic or symptoms B. Nor does cutaneous lesions or adenopathies present. In addition, pulmonary images are in remission, so it seems logical to consider the infectious or inflammatory etiology. Among the infectious causes are the fungal, parasitic and those produced by mycobacteria. All of them with a negative result in the complementary study. Thus, the presence of these involutive pseudonodules could be justified by the pro -inflammatory waterfall that takes place in HIV patients at the beginning of the TARV. However, it should be noted that in the complementary study IgG positive against Strongyloides. Estrongiloidiasis is an endemic parasitosis in tropical or subtropical climate countries, acute infection is generally asymptomatic and has a tendency to chronicity. In HIV patients there is a risk of extraintestinal dissemination, giving rise to hyperinfestation syndrome, especially when T CD4+ lymphocyte count is less than 200 cells/mm3. Disseminated forms often pursue without eosinophilia (sign of gravity and poor prognosis) and when there are symptoms, these are usually sporadic and long -lasting. Among the most common are diarrhea and malabsorption, cough and pruritus. All of them with intensity proportional to the number of parasites. The most commonly used method to confirm the diagnosis is the identification of larvae in stool, sputum and tissues although sometimes the Helminto is not displayed. Therefore, multiple serial studies are precise in agar crops or the separation of larvae by the Baermann method, the profitability of both tests being greater as many times as repeated and consecutively. The presence of specific IgG antibodies are found in cases of stongiloidiasis with or without immunosuppression, lack protective capacity for dissemination and are not severity indicators. However, its identification is useful for the diagnosis whose sensitivity can reach 97%. The patient currently has no clinic or alterations in complementary tests compatible with a hyperinfestation syndrome by Strongyloides. However, due to its epidemiological and medical history, and before clinic and serology compatible with stongiloidiasis, it is decided to initiate treatment for infection with ivermectin objectifying improvement.

Clinical judgment

Notable thickening (3.8mm) of the posterior pole of the right ocular globe in probable relationship to the chorio-retinitis mentioned. Findings that suggest multiple brain metastases, especially after troaco-abdominal TAC.

Diagnosis
Masquerade syndrome (diffuse choroiditis + papillitis) as the first manifestation of left urinary tract tumor with metastasis at the pulmonary level and CNS.

Treatment and evolution
After more than 10 days in internal medicine, with the hydronephrosis caused by the ureteral lesion visualized by ultrasound and in the face of the deterioration of renal function, transfer is decided by Urology. In Urology they perform ureteroscopy and biopsies. It is discharged a week after being in charge of Urology, with permeable nephrostomy catheter, with persistence, and even slight worsening of renal failure (CR 1.86 and FG 39), being hemodynamically stable, shave and with clear urines. Ten days after discharge, the results of pathological anatomy are obtained, which report the compatibility of samples with urootelial origin tumor through ureteral washing. A month later the patient is referred to medical oncology, where they guide palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin and gemcitabine, given the extension of the disease and the poor prognosis of it."

63 -year -old woman with the following personal history: HTA, rectum neoplasia treated with surgery, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism and radiotherapy (complete remission), secondary lymphedema to radiotherapy, MCLEOD syndrome (peripheral neuropathy, myocardiopathy, hemolytic anemia with acanthosis and respiratory insufficiency) and venous insufficiency. Regular treatment: ENALAPRIL, LEVOTIROROXIN, ROCALTROL AND MASTICAL D. Enter in Axarqu√≠a Hospital by Asttenia and progressive edema in both lower members, 1 month of evolution. In the last 2 weeks, acute gastroenteritis picture (treated with ciprofloxacin) and in recent days, erythematous lesions and with a temperature increase in distal lower limb, suggestive of cellulite. Occasionally, urinary incontinence, coluria and foamy characteristic urine, but denies voiding syndrome. After approaching with furosemide and ceftriaxone I.V., decreased peripheral edema but increased ascites was objectified. After this, they made an abdominal tac with contrast and at 2 days, new increase in edema, Oligoanuria and deterioration of renal function (creatinine 1.6 mg/dl). For this reason it is transferred to HRU Carlos Haya to complete study.

Peri hepatic and periesplenic liquid. Ri√±ones with increased attenuation. Right posterolateral wall tracheal diverticulum. Echocardiogram: Severe left ventricular hypertrophy, with systolic dysfunction in limits and diastolic dysfunction. Mild pericardial spill surrounding the left atrium.

Differential diagnosis
It is a nephrotic syndrome with deterioration of renal function (without prior nephropathy), in the context of radiological study with contrast. With all these data, the following diagnostic options are considered to admission: glomerular disease:
¬∑ Minimum changes or lipoid nephrosis: It is usually more frequent in children between 2 and 10 years. So it is unlikely.
¬∑ Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis: more frequent in adolescents.
¬∑ Membranous nephropathy or membranoproliferrative glomerulonephritis: <1% of cases.
Within this group it is the most compatible with our case.
Systemic disease: Les, viral infections (HIV, hepatitis B and C), bacterial infections (streptococcal tonsillitis, etc.), vasculitis, multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, etc. These entities are the most compatible with the painting, but they have already been ruled out with blood analytics except multiple myeloma and amyloidosis. So we should continue to perform more complementary tests to confirm or discard these last two processes

Complementary tests
Renal biopsy: GLOSPULULAR APPROACH GLOMERULES THAT IMPRESS OF AMILOIDOSIS. It is observed that the AA -dyed -dyed amyloid deposit area with immunohistochemistry technique coincides with that of the Kappa light chain tank. In principle, it seems something contradictory, since the two types of amyloids cannot be dyed at the same time. The test is repeated, obtaining the same results. Bone marrow biopsy: myelogram: good lump marrow, cellularity, quite fat in some of the lumps. Presence of all populations in their varied maturational forms with plasma in 7% of cell phone, mature morphology and without the presence of intermediate lymphoid elements. J.C: Hematopoietic marrow. Flow citometry: 3% of anomalous phenotype plasma cells, typical of myelomatous plasma cells, next to 0.2% of normal plasma cells of normal phenotype.

Final diagnosis
Primary amyloidosis with possible AA amyloid coexistence (cardiac infiltration, renal, digestive and neuropathic).

Evolution
At the entrance, eco -gum renal biopsy is made, in which AA amyloid deposit is evidenced, as well as IF positive to Kappa chains. In the analytics it stands out: nephrotic proteinuria, presence of c. Light Kappa in urine. In blood, absence of monoclonal peak, but presence of light Kappa chains and altered quotient. Hypogammaglobulinemia global, with normal accessories. Important dissociated colstasis pattern, severe increase in GGT and LDH. With these data, the hematology service is consulted, which performs a flow cytometry, in which the presence of 3% of plasma cells of anomalous Kappa phenotype is reported. Finally, it is concluded that it is a primary amyloidosis, with possible AA amyloid coexistence. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and steroids begins as indications of the Hematology Service, and must continue reviews in external consultation of hematology and nephrology."
"45 -year -old man with a history of severe smoking, severe obesity (BMI 37.8) and multiple discos. It presents high fever (so blood cultures are extracted) and appearance, two days after fever, violet injuries in the lower left member. The blood cultures indicate the presence of S. aureus resistant to cloxacillin (the first drug that was paid) for what is treated with vancomycin. Trans -critical echocardiography that reveals the presence of filiform vegetations in aortic valve was performed. In addition, the patient has abdominal pain that leads to ultrasound that indicates the presence of splenic infarctions and a renal. Valvular replacement is programmed that takes place at the week of the beginning of the picture and gentamycin was added to the treatment. The day prior to surgery (day 6 with antibiotic treatment) is decided to readjust the treatment removing vancomycin and adding daptomycin in a dose of 3.5mg/kg/day (that is, at this time the patient is being treated with daptomycin and gentamycin). After presenting an adequate evolution, he restarted fever so abdominal tomography objectifying splenic abscesses. Drainage of the largest guided by ultrasound was performed obtaining samples for cultivation in which Serratia Marcescens was isolated. The patient presented an adequate evolution again until at 21 days of treatment began with a chest dyspnea, dyspnea and pain, so that thoracic tac was performed in which pulmonary infiltrate in tired glass infiltrate patching, larger in the upper right lobe, right middle lobe and lower left lobe is described. Four days later it has greater dyspnea and respiratory failure that does not improve oxygen therapy. When performing thorax radiography, interstitial pattern is observed that agrees with the findings observed in the TC of previous days, so bronchoscopy was requested and bronchoalveolar washing that indicates polymorphic inflammatory cell phone with just over 10% of eosinophils. On the other hand, an exponential increase in blood eosinophile figures was also objectified at that time. Because of this, it was decided to withdraw daptomycin and start treatment with corticosteroids getting improvement in the painting."
"Personal Background and Current Clinical History
It is a 58 -year -old male with a personal history of HT and hyperuricemia with gout crisis. Chronic renal failure known since July 2012. Hernia Disc L5-S1. Enter infectious CCEE with a diagnosis of fever of unknown origin of prolonged duration. For five months he had low -grade fever, up to 38OC, of ‚Äã‚Äãintermittent appearance, without symptoms for devices. No relevant epidemiological history except contact with properly vaccinated dog. The day of admission, consult again, referring to continue with a fever of up to 2-3 weekly days, with slight epigastralgia and some isolated vomit in recent days, so income is decided to expand study.

Physical examination
Upon arrival he presented good general condition, conscious and oriented. Good skin hydration and mucous membranes. EUPneico at rest, tensional figures 125/68 mmHg. No palpable adenopathies or goiter. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, without blows or extrathones. At the pulmonary level it had good vesicular murmur without pathological noise over -added. The abdomen was soft, depressible without megalias, with slight discomfort to the palpation at the epigastrium level. No edemas in lower limbs or deep vein thrombosis signs. Non -stiffness or skin lesions. ORL exploration without findings.

Initial complementary tests
The tests performed in the infectious plant to our patient were the following: Hemogram: Hemoglobin 11 mg/dl, 35%hematocrit, average corpuscular volume 93.6 fl, leukocytes 6890 cells/mm3 with normal differential formula and normal platelets, globular sedimentation speed 59 mm/h.

As for image tests, initially an abdomen ultrasound was performed objectifying likely hepatic steatosis, simple cyst (18*15 mm) in segment II, III and IV. Increased augmented prostate with calcification in its secondary thickness to previous prostatitis. In the thorax/abdomen TAC as data to highlight is the presence of supracardial mediastinal adenopathies (the largest at the pre -tracheal situation level and retrove Abdominal is observed light hepatomegaly with small cystic formations compatible with bile cysts, light splenomegaly. generalized adenopathies, but finally did not be carried out, for not impressing the infiltrative process by those of peripheral blood findings.

Initial evolution
During its favorable evolution entrance, 38oC febrile peak presented on one occasion. At discharge, asymptomatic and AFEBRIL, referring to CCEE of infectious, for evolutionary control, being aware of the result of pathological biopsy anatomy, programming study according to findings.

Initial clinical judgment
Prolonged intermittent fever without focus and generalized lymphadenopathies under study. Duodenal mucous lesions pending anatomopathological diagnosis.

Differential diagnosis
Before a patient with prolonged unknown fever (it is defined, as an occasional fever greater than 38.3 ¬∞ C for three weeks or greater than 37.5 ¬∞ C consistently for 2 weeks without diagnosis after exams have been performed during a week of hospitalization) we have to take into account four groups in terms of etiologies:
¬∑ Infectious: abdominal and pelvic abscesses, bile roads infection, tuberculosis, endocarditis, prostatitis, spondylitis, osteomyelitis, dental/brain abscesses, infections due Yersinia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Legionella, Leptospirosis, Borreliosis, Paludism, Visceral Leishmaniasis ...
¬∑ Neoplasias: Atrial mixome, colon carcinoma, kaposi sarcoma, lung carcinoma, multiple myelom Hypersensitivity vasculitis to drugs, knuckle panarteritis, systemic lupus, mixed connective tissue disease, ankylosing spondylitis, Takayasu arteritis, Beh√ßet disease, Wegener granulomatosis ...
¬∑ Miscellaneous: Sarcoidosis, Idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis, intestinal inflammatory disease, family Mediterranean fever, drugs, acute alcoholic hepatitis, thyroiditis/ hyperthyroidism, hidden bruises, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, kikuchi disease, castleman, hypertriglyceridemia, manufacturing and gaucher disease, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia, central hypertermia FEATHER FEVER AND SELF -UNDUCK, CIRCADIAN RY RY DISORDERS ...
In our case, different etiologies were dismissed, due to the patient's history, clinic by organs and devices, and according to the results that were obtained from both laboratory and image techniques.

Final diagnostic test
High digestive endoscopy: stomach, pylorus and bulb within normality. Moderate edema along with multiple whitish deposits in rice grain in second duodenal portion. Biopsy is taken.

Final diagnosis
Given the result of duodenal biopsy we can conclude that we are facing a case of Whipple disease

Final evolution
Once the result of pathological anatomy is obtained, the diagnosis being conclusive, the patient is informed and admission is decided to initiate intravenous treatment with ceftriaxone (2 gr IV/day) for 2 weeks, to continue with oral treatment with trimetropin-sulfametoxazole (160/800 mg 2 tablets/12 hours). The patient has been reviewed in consultation, being the last one, in April 2013 (after 14 months of treatment), the asymptomatic patient and fever remission, it is decided to finish antibiotic treatment, he plans to perform high control digestive endoscopy, in July 2013."
"Reason for consultation
Pain and inflammation in left hemiabdomen.

Anamnesis and physical examination
40 -year -old male, without personal history of interest, drinker about three beers per day, without habitual home treatment. Consultation in the Emergency Department for presenting fever of up to 38oc and pain with a sense of inflammation in left hemiabdomen of about 20 days of evolution. Dyspnea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoderate efforts during the last ten days, without accompanying cough or expectoration. It has not had weight loss or night sweating, nor does it refer to other symptoms in anamnesis due to devices. He had attended at the beginning of the painting twice to his reference regional hospital where analytics had been performed in which mild leukocytes and PCR elevation stood Perceive the patient improvement of the painting. A physical examination has blood pressure 140/100 mmhg, heart rate of 100 LPM, basal oxygen saturation 93%, temperature 37.5oc. The general state is good, with a good level of consciousness and orientation in the three spheres. No existence of cervical or axillary adenopathies. Cardiac auscultation is rhythmic, without blows and in the respiratory hyperventilation is objective on the left. Soft abdomen, not painful to palpation, without palpating masses or megalias, in the lateral and posterior zone of the left hemiabdomen presents edematization of the area, slightly erythematous and augmented temperature with respect to the rest. Limbs without edema, with palpable pulses and without other alterations. Adenopathies are not palpated at the cervical, armpit or inguinal level. The exploration of the cranial pairs is normal and retains intact strength, muscle tone and sensitivity.

Complementary tests
In the analytics performed in the emergency department, a hematimetry stands out with 106000 leukocytes/ Œºl, with a normal leukocyte formula, hemoglobin 13.8 g/ dl, platelets 183000/ Œºl. Coagulation with 75% prothrombin activity. Biochemistry with glucose, renal function and normal ions, PCR 47. Chest radiography shows a left pleura spill. The electrocardiogram presents a sinus rhythm, at 85 LPM, with normal QRS axis and without alterations of repolarization. An abdomen ultrasound was also performed in which there is a thickening of abdominal, width and serrated left over -sized muscle belly, in addition to inflammatory changes in subcutaneous cellular tissue and slight changes in attenuation of the fat of the posts and the left iliac. With these data, internal medicine hospitalization plant is entered for study of localized or focal myositis.

Differential diagnosis
Myositis is an inflammation of the musculoskeletal tissue that may be caused by different pathologies. Infection is an uncommon cause within soft tissue infections. It can be caused by multiple pathogens, including viruses (group B or HIV group), bacterial trichinosis and infections. In addition, in the case of penetrating wounds contaminated by spores of Clostridium Perfringens, which causes gas gangrene
1. Inflammatory myopathies include a heterogeneous group of muscle diseases that have in common a muscular weakness of subacute or chronic course and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in muscle biopsy. Polymanitis characterized by weak and symmetrical predominance weakness of chronic course, in addition to systemic manifestations, are found in this group. Dermatomyositis is also included, characterized by a asthenia and fever picture, subsequently muscle involvement and appearance of skin lesions. Finally, Miosotis by inclusion bodies is the only most prevalent in men, it is characterized by weak and symmetrical course, initially in lower extremities, and atrophy of the affected muscles.
2 Metabolic myopathies have anomalies in muscular energy metabolism, muscle biopsy reveals fiber necrosis and phagocytosis, in addition to esonophilic miosotis as part of an eosinophilic syndrome, granulomatous myositis (isolated or associated with granulomatous syndromes). Other diseases to consider in diagnosis especially when the shape is located is muscle cancer and/or thrombophlebitis.
3 The diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies is suspected on the basis of clinical characteristics and is confirmed by laboratory tests, serum muscle enzyme concentration, the presence of autoantibodies, electromyography and muscular biopsy. Recently they have been introduced as auxiliary tools in the process of differential diagnosis of myopathies magnetic resonance and muscle ultrasound studies. The definitive diagnostic procedure is muscular biopsy, which must ideally be performed before the start of the treatment and is usually taken from the vastolateral, deltoid or biceps brachial muscles, verifying that the muscle does not show severe atrophy.3

Bottom line
In our case, the patient has very localized myositis, with exclusive affectation of the muscle belly of the chest and abdominal wall, in addition to affecting the subcutaneous cell tissue. Given the patient's epidemiological history, the diagnosis of trichinosis was raised, so treatment with albendazole and antibiotrapy aimed at cellulite secondary to the process he presented was initiated. Hemocultures, coproultures and serology (including Tricin Spiralis) with a negative result were also taken. The patient's muscular lesion did not present improvement despite the beginning of the treatment, with even progression to other muscle belly, in addition, the pleural spill worsened progressively, torocentesis was performed diagnostic compatible with exudate, which was sent to microbiology and pathological anatomy obtaining negative result for malignant cells although suggestive of inflammatory process with abundant eosinophilia. Finally, it was necessary to perform a pleural drainage due to respiratory failure with massive pleural effusion. Before the persistence of the symptoms, a muscular magnetic resonance (NMR) was requested in which an unstructuring of the muscular wall was objectified, with inflammatory changes, fundamental affectation of the muscles of the lateral abdominal wall and left flank, which showed irregular enhancement with the contrast without appreciating drainage organized collections, in addition to edema in the fat of the abdominal wall The abdominal cavity. Finally, it was decided to perform muscle biopsy by surgery, sending the sample to the laboratories of microbiology and pathological anatomy of our center. The microbiological study was negative. The anatomopathological study is fibroadipose tissue and you do striated muscle that show infiltration by a proliferation of large -sized cells and oval nucleus accompanied by numerous eosinophils, after immunohistochemical study they determine the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative process type Type Type Typphoma T Peripheral of immunophenotype t aberrant. The patient is valued by the Oncology Service, which initiates chemotherapeutic treatment with chop scheme with the hospitalized patient, with good tolerance by the patient so it is decided at home to continue treatment and follow -up in an outpatient basis. Currently, chemotherapeutic treatment has ended and in the last revisions it is in full remission situation."

41 -year -old male patient. Banking director.

Personal history
¬∑ Dyslipidemia, asymptomatic hyperuricemia and ease glucose alteration.
¬∑ Probable Nash (2006). Serologies for negative B and C viruses.
¬∑ Atypical chest pain studied in 2006 with echocardiogram (left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function (Fe = 0.72), diastolic dysfunction) and negative effort test.
¬∑ Anxious syndrome since 1998.

Family history
There is no relevant family history. Toxic habit: smoker of 10 cigarettes/day (accumulated consumption of 20 packages-year). Moderate sporadic consumption of alcohol. Treatment: Escitalopram 20 mg (1-0-0). Lorazepam 2.5 mg (1-0-2). Bisoprolol 5 mg (1-0-0). Gemfibrozilo 600 mg (0-0-1).

Current history
Patient who goes to the emergency department of our center by presenting intense muscle pain in the right arm of 4 hours of evolution, without apparent triggers. It associates great concern and anxiety about the possible cardiological origin of symptoms. It does not refer dyspnea, orthopnea or nocturnal paroxysmal dyspnea. He has not presented presyncopales or syncopes episodes previously or other accompanying respiratory symptoms. Although he comments that the pain is of different characteristics, the patient had been previously studied by cardiology in 2006 when presenting an episode of chest pain of atypical characteristics apparently related to excessive consumption of alcohol. In the study carried out, high levels of CPK were objectified, with an echocardiogram and an effort test without anomalies, discarding a cardiological origin of both the symptoms and of the analytical alterations (it does not attach report of the tests performed). Based on these data, it is carried out in ECG (no signs of acute ischemia) and basic analytics where it highlights increased GOT/GPT 31/71 UI/L (N: 0-37/0-41) with other normal liver tests, CPK of 252 IU/L (N: 0-170UI/L) and aldolase of 7.9 UI/L (N: 0-7 UI/L). Inflammatory parameters (VSG and PCR) within normality, with renal normofunction without hydroelectrolytic alteration, HB 15.4 g/dl, platelets 263 10E9/L, leukocytes 6.2 10E9/L. Normal coagulation. Abnormal and sediment without alteration. Given these results, pain is attributed to a probable osteo-muscular origin and the patient is derived to internal medicine consultation to verify and complete mild analytical alteration study. In internal medicine consultation, the patient who describes from childhood intolerance to the exercise manifested in the form of asthenia and generalized myalgias, both at the proximal and distal level of extremities, without arthritis, or cutaneous-milks of new appearance.

Anamnesis by devices
He has not presented fever or cramps. No loss of muscle mass. No fasciculations or sensitive symptoms. It leads a relatively normal life, with the limitation described for the practice of some sport and that conditions it to lead a relatively sedentary life. No cough or phlegm. No recent infectious paintings. No abdominal pain. Intestinal habit conserved with 1 deposition to the day without pathological products. The patient provides previous analytics where significant variations in CPK figures are objective in recent years coinciding apparently with the taking of statins and moderate consumption of concomitant alcohol. Additionally, it presents chronic and fluctuating hypertransaminasemia without episodes of jaundice or other suggestive signs of liver decompensation that are attributed to possible non -alcoholic steatohepatitis with negative viral serologies. Different tests had previously been performed (RM of whole body, electrophysiological study, liver biopsy) without finding alterations.

Physical examination
T.A.: 110/70 mmhg. FC: 79/minute. AFEBRIL SAT.02: 96%. BMI: 28 kg/m2. Good general condition. Good skin coloration and mucous membranes. Faringe: Normal. Cardiac auscultation: without alterations. Pulmonary auscultation: normal. Abdomen: soft, depressible, without pain or megalias. Limbs: peripheral pulses, not edema. No pain to palpation. No signs of arthritis. Anodine neurological exploration.

Evolution and discussion of the clinical case
After reviewing the available tests and rehistorrating the patient, we orient the studies towards a picture of intolerance to the exercise in the form of asthenia and myalgias accompanied by oscillating levels of CPK and slight hypertransaminasemia, without elevation of inflammatory parameters or signs suggestive of first or second motoneurone disease. Likewise, in the absence of compatible skin lesions and muscle weakness characteristics, we reasonably discard the diagnoses of polymiositis and/or dermatomyositis. The diagnostic approach that we follow was the following:

1. Given the possibility of an adverse medication reaction we review and remove the potentially involved drugs (Gemfibrocil/benzodiazepines/escitalopram).
2. Serologies were requested against CMV, Epstein Barr, Herpes Virus and HIV, negative and studied study of hypertransaminasemia through serologies for VHA, B and C. We add autoimmunity study (ANA, AMA, ASMA and ANTI-LKM) Obtaining Ana Patron Nucleolar 1: 320 and asthma 1:80.
3. We complete study with the realization of abdominal doppler ultrasound observing diffuse hepatic steatosis with a perivular preservation area, without evidenced solid focal lesions. Multiple vesicular polyps (probably cholesterol) with normal caliber route.
Once the possible CPK lifting etiologies have been discarded, we orient the case towards a possible hereditary myopathy. Therefore, we delve into the family history and the characteristics of the patient's symptomatology. No one from his family environment had a similar clinic and in terms of symptomatology, the patient referred early fatigue and myalgia with improvement of exercise tolerance after several minutes from the beginning. A literature review was carried out and we found three large groups within hereditary myopathies:
¬∑ Glycogenesis,
¬∑ Lipid metabolism alterations
¬∑ Mitochondrial diseases.
By order of frequency, including the three groups, three entities stand out:
¬∑ The carnitine deficit Palmitail Transferaas II (CPT II),
¬∑ The myophosphorylase deficit (mcardle disease (v))
¬∑ The Kinase phosphorylase deficit (VIII).
According to the diagnostic algorithm ----, the elevation of CPK figures along with a severe intolerance to exercise (in the form of asthenia and myalgias) from the beginning of it but that significantly improves at 5-10 minutes, are highly suggestive of McCardle's disease. Therefore, we performed an ischemia test where a discreet lactic elevation compatible with difficulty in glycogen metabolism was confirmed. Muscle biopsy was performed that verified the presence of skeletal muscle tissue striated with structural conservation and a relative increase in the amount of glycogen of muscle fibers. In the immunohistochemical study carried out, the absence of history against myophosphoryllase, normality of the rest of historic patterns, confirming the existence of a myopathy myofosphoryllase deficit corresponding to McCardle disease."
"42 -year -old male without personal history of interest, which began studied by analytical appearance compatible with dissociated cholestasis; During the clinical interview the patient does not refer to any symptomatology by organs and devices of interest. In the analytics, only GGT 330 and FA 218 stands out. Abdomen ultrasound is performed where living and spleening space injuries are displayed, the study is completed with the realization of a thorax and abdomen CT and abdomen evidenced by multiple hypodense lesions of small both in liver and in the spleen without finding adenopathies in any of the compartments studied. In the Toracoabdominal TAC, bilateral lateocervical adenopathies smaller than 1 cm can be seen, without evidence of other adenopathies or mediastinal or abdominal. The pulmonary pattern does not present lesions, on the spleen and the liver, multiple hypodense lesions suggestive of metastases are described. The abdominal NMR study is completed to better define injuries and finding the same results. Complete analytical analytical is performed with negative autoimmunity (ANA and AMAS) and negative serology for VHB-VHC-VIH-BRUCELLA-RICEKTTSIA-COXIELLA BURNNETTII-TREPONEMA PALLIDUM, A HEPATIC BIOPSY OF THE INJURY DESCRIBED WITH THE FINDINGS OF GRANULOMS THAT DOES NOT SHOW. To detect resistant alcohol acid bacilli, it was negative as well as the PCR and TBC culture technique; Finally, granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis."
"18 -year -old woman, with a history of congenital left renal agenesis. Valued per 10 -day box high fever with cough and expectoration, which does not improve despite antibiotic therapy. He arrives febrile and in respiratory failure. In leukocytosis and thrombocytosis analytics, quick of 49%. RXTX with pleural spill to apex. Torococentesis is performed, obtaining purulent fluid (with empyema and ada features of 1u/L), a pleural drainage tube is placed. Enter U. intensive, there is feverish despite ATB wide spectrum and develop fistulous path from pleural to skin. In pleural fluid Actinomyces Turicensis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were isolated. It was treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. The serological and immune study, did not demonstrate immunosuppression. After 2 months of admission and good radiological evolution, drainage could be removed. As a complication associated with cutaneous rash (generalized maculo-p√°pular, which affects palms), with marked edematization, PCR elevation, lymphocytosis and splenomegaly (SDME DRESS). Tto with penicillin and clindamycin is suspended, starting steroids and doxycycline. The evolution is favorable, with normalization of RXTX and acute phase reactants. Antibiotic therapy is suspended at 10 months.
Actinomycosis is an uncommon disease characterized by the formation of abceduses, tissue fibrosis, and fistulization. Caused by gram positive bacteria, anaerobias not forming spores, of the genus Actinomyces. Boca, straight and genital tract colonizers. The most frequent locations are cervicofacial, thoracic, CNS and pelvic.
Thoracic actimomycosis can affect pulmonary parenchyma, pleura or mediastinum. Transmission forms includes microaspirations, direct extension/fistulization of cervicofacial, mediastinal or retroperitoneal infection (pelvic absence).
The clinic is larvada, similar to tuberculosis; coughing, weight loss, fever and chest pain. It has frequently described in immunosuppressed patients. It is more frequent in immunocompromised patients, however in some cases there is no underlying or immunosuppression disease.
The peculiarity of the case is the form of acute and serious presentation, which is atypical in this type of infections. It is also a young, immunocompetent patient, without primary cervicofacial/dental alterations."

"48 -year -old patient, resident in Zamora, with a history of monocytic ascites of unloaded etiology despite two exploratory laparoscopies, with informed peritoneal sample of reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. In one of the multiple evacuating palacesis is in the adenosine adenosine) positive. The mantoux test is also being positive, starting antituberculous treatment. Months later follow -up due to hematology due to severe thrombopenia. Bone marrow biopsy compatible with PTI is performed. Despite the treatment, the patient continued with platelet, presenting an epistaxis that did not cease after plugging, indicating urgent splenectomy. In this income, peritoneum biopsy and a palpable axillary ganglion were obtained, where intense peritoneal mesothelial hyperplasia associated with intense and diffuse hyperplasia was observed. The patient re -entered by bilateral acute TEP and TVP in the left humeral, so HBPM began at therapeutic doses.
The case was referred to the La Paz hospital in Madrid to complete study. He referred fever, evening sweating, intense asthenia with arthromialgia, left baseline pleuritic pain with a frequent dry sensation and cough. During his entry, diagnostic paracentesis of dense and yellowish liquid was performed, with biochemical profile equal to that analyzed in Zamora, being the sterile culture and B.A.A.R.R negative. In the thorax angio-tac, replacement defects were appreciated in relation to acute pulmonary thromboembolism. Massive left pleural spill with compressive atelectasis of Pathological mediastinal adenopathies prevailed. The ganglionic sample obtained in Zamora was reviewed being informed as a Castlemanoid process, with reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, without malignancy data. The cytokine profile, with high levels of IL-6, supports the diagnosis of (ECM) Castelman's disease; And while the serology for VVH8 and VHI was negative, the serology for VVH6 was positive (1/640). After the beginning of steroids, immunoglobulins and Rituximab showed clinical, analytical and radiological improvement.

Maltophilia, under treatment with calcium and vitamin D by osteopenia, which begins follow -up in November 2014 by thrombopenia and splenomegaly of chronic course. The physical examination highlights splenic pole 4 cm under the costal flange, without other findings. Analytically, HB 17.3 g/dl, platelets 63000/ul (88000 per manual count), leukocytes 3500/ul, peripheral blood smeso Beta-2-Microglobulin 2 mg/l; HIV Serologies, HBB, VHC, VHS, VVZ, CMV, VEB, TOXOPLASMA, SYPHILIS, ANTIGENURIA DE LEISHMANIA AND NEGATIVE AUTOINMUNITY. In abdominal TC, splenomegaly of 15 cm and hepatomegaly is evidenced with the right hepatic lobe 18 cm in longitudinal diameter, with normal Doppler study. In May 2015, the patient entered the left basal pneumonia without microbiological insulation, continuing outpatient study. In electrophoretic profile persists hypogammaglobulinemia (gamma band 6.8%) at the expense of IG G and IG A, associated with CD4 lymphopenia and mild lymphocytosis B, with adequate immunovacunal response, negative gaucher test, alpha-1-normal festival. The patient remains asymptomatic, without semiological or analytical changes until March 2016, when he consults for pain in the left hipochondrium in the previous 4 days, irradiated to ipsilateral scapula, without constitutional picture or symptoms B, evidencing splenomegaly massive that exceeds midline and reaches up to 4 cm on the left iliac crest. Analytically highlights HB 10.3 g/dl, platelets 56000/ul, leukocytes 2500/ul, LDH 350 U/L, beta-2-microglobulin 6.8 mg/l, gamma band 5.7%, coombs direct polyespecific negative, smear and immunophenotype of peripheral blood without findings. Bone marrow biopsy and T√≥co-Abd√≥mino-P√©lvico tC is performed objectifying splenomegaly of 23x19x10 cm with incipient defect of subcapsular perfusion. In Pet-Tac, an increase in metabolic activity is evident in a spleen and supra and infragmatic adenopathies.

"83 -year -old male with a history of hypertension, COPD stage D with severe functional and recent diagnosis of ascending colon neoplasia conservatively treated by comorbidity. It also highlights ERC Stage 3 and Symptomatic HBP that requires permanent bladder probing.
Enter for deterioration of the general state of a week of evolution and for having appreciated purple coloration of urine in the probe bag. It denys fever or other focused symptomatology. In the exploration, signs of severe caloric malnutrition (BMI 15.8 kg/m2) are evidenced despite an acceptable oral intake and the taking of hyperproteic nutritional supplements.
In the complementary tests requested at your entry,: deterioration of renal function and anemic syndrome, both stable with respect to previous controls (creatinine 2.10 mg/dl, urea 173 mg/dl, Hb 107 g/l), urine elementary with leukocyturia and uroculture that 48 hours later, is positive for E. coli (> 100,000 UFC/ml).
Broken urine syndrome is a rare entity that characteristically affects elderly women with prolonged bladder probing and weakened by chronic diseases. The presence of previous urological pathology, prolonged running and chronic constipation are predisposing factors.
It occurs in the presence of high concentrations of bacteria with Indexilsulfatase/phosphatase activity (proteus genera, providence, pseudomonas or E. coli, among others) that develop in an alkaline environment. It is not usually associated with greater morbidity, and in most cases it is resolved with replacement of bladder survey, hygienic measures and antibiotic treatment. In general, they are little symptomatic infections, most of the razing patients, without leukocytosis or other relevant data.
The purple color is due to the conversion of the Indexil Sulfate, Metabolite of the tryptophan, in Indexil by the action of sulfathous enzymes/bacterial phosphatases. Once in the bag, when coming into contact with oxygen, it transforms into an indigo and indirubin, whose mixture originates a purple tone. The oxidation process takes a few hours, so the urine initially has a normal appearance and the coloration can be seen time later in the collecting bag. In this case, we consider that the use of nutritional supplements rich in tryptophan, played an important role in the development of this syndrome."
"81 -year -old male, with a history of HTA, dyslipidemia and atrial fibrillation in treatment as well as recent trip to South Africa. Enter for five -day fever box with multiple vesiculous punctual lesions of different morphology in the lower extremities, as well as the right buttock buttock of erythema surrounded by erythema.

The result of the complementary study demonstrated mild transaminase alteration together with neutrophilia and elevation of the PCR, with radiographs without relevant alterations. Hemocultures, malaria and staining test that were negative, as well as the serologies of VHA, HBB, HCV, HIV, Coxiella Burnetti, Borrelia Burgdorferi and Leishmania, being positive the serology of Rickettsia. In this patient, before the clinic presented and the antecedent of a trip to the endemic zone of Rickettsia with positive serology, the start of treatment with doxycycline is decided, with the disappearance of the fever, being at the discharge asymptomatic.

In the first place, positivity was obtained from Rickettsia Conorii by cross reaction, being subsequently evidenced (by sending the samples to the reference center) the positivity of African rickettsia.

African tick fever should be taken into account in patients with suggestive clinic and the trip to susceptible areas, since it is one of the imported rickettsiosis more frequently. African tick bite fever caused by African Rickettsia is mainly established in rural areas of sub -Saharan countries and Caribbean islands, transmitted by vectors (amblyomma hebraeum and A. variegatum ticks) with an average incubation of 7 days. The clinic consists fundamentally by fever, headache with Escara and Regional Lymphadenopathy."

"51 -year -old patient who goes to the emergency department for a 10 -day fever of evolution. It does not refer to interest with 12 cigarette/day smoking. In anamnesis, it refers to distmerm sensation denying infectious symptoms at any level. Refers excursions to the field to collect mushrooms, denying insect bites. It does not refer relevant epidemiological history except contact with Mexican relatives, who come to Spain after the death of their brother. In the Emergency Department the patient remains hemodynamically stable, with a temperature of 37.6oc; Normal physical examination, without objectified skin lesions. Analytically highlights mild thrombopenia (105,000), discreet hypertransaminasemia, in addition to elevation of other acute phase reactants. Thorax radiography without consolidated pneumonic. Enter internal medicine (M.I.) for study of febrile syndrome without focus.
At the entrance the patient remains AFEBRIL. Reinterrogated refers to contact with a newborn lamb two weeks before the start of symptomatology. At this time, a evanescent morbiliform rash, rest without changes, can be seen in physical examination. In the analytics only hypertransaminasemia persists. Abdominal ultrasound is requested where mild hepatoesplenomegaly is observed. Viral and bacterial serologies are requested by registering with two weeks in M.I.
Without waiting for the consultation, he goes to the Emergencies seven days later due to the recurrence of fever, so he re -enters M.I. (Normal and analytical exploration in which hypertransaminasemia persists). Serologies are negative for hepatotropos viruses, HIV, CMV, toxoplasma, leishmania, treponemics and rickettsias, indeterminate IGM for CMV; being positive IGM of Veb, IGM and IgG of Borrellia and IGM of Coxiella with negative IgG.

"We present a clinical case that we consider of special interest in clinical practice, due to the characteristics of the patient, the associated bad prognosis factors and the torpid evolution despite achieving good control in the treatment of HIV infection. This is a 28 -year -old male, diagnosed in September 2012 of HIV infection following a picture of acute pharyngoamigdalitis and skin predominance lesions. The immune situation at that time was 334 CD4/mm3 (24%) and viral load (CV) of 115,000 copies/ml. Simultaneously, he was diagnosed with secondary syphilis, receiving penicillin treatment, but without performing any treatment for HIV infection and maintaining, sporadically, unprotected sexual relations (man who has sex with men).
In January 2015, it began progressively with dyspnea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoderate efforts, cough and expectoration with occasional blood remains and weight loss, going to the external consultation of internal medicine in May 2015 where hospital admission is decided to complete study. During admission, he recognizes the appearance of skin lesions in 2013, which has not disappeared completely. On physical examination, multiple lesions are observed on the lights and violets located in a dispersed trunk, upper and lower limbs, neck, right palatine region and retropharyngeal and inguinal region, where they formed an indurated and painful conglomerate to the palpation. In addition, it presented other millimeter lesions in torso, left intercostal region and back, which initially simulated folliculitis, but that in the thorough exploration suggested Herpes Z√≥ster Metharie. In the anal-perianal region, it had nonspecific superficial ulcerated lesions, predominant in the interglugal region. In mucous exploration, oropharyngeal candidiasis was objectified. With a diagnosis of HIV infection Stage C, without treatment, cutaneous lesions compatible with Kaposi sarcoma, visceral (pulmonary) affectation clinic and oropharyngeal candidiasis, complementary diagnostic tests are requested. The analytical count of CD4 was 268 CD4/mm3, the CV of 809,978 copies/ml, HLA B 5701 negative and genotypic resistance test without mutations for inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors. Antiretroviral treatment (TAR) was initiated with Tenofovir/Emtricitabine, Raltegravir and Darunavir enhanced with Ritonavir In addition, it is added fluconazole, cotrimoxazole and empirical antibiotic treatment for pneumonia acquired in the community (NAC), with cefotaxima and claitromycin. Radiography and computerized tomography (TC) of thorax and histopathological study of skin, pulmonary and ganglionic samples were performed, confirming the diagnosis of kaposi sarcoma. All crops were negative. Empirical antibiotic treatment was suspended for NAC, maintaining only cotrimoxazole as secondary prophylaxis against P. Jirovecii infection. During the first days of income worsened, specifying admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) specifying non -invasive mechanical ventilation. Simultaneously, the first line of oncological treatment with liposomal doxorubicin began, with good tolerance and initial clinical response and remained until a total of 6 cycles was completed obtaining as a maximum radiological response a stabilization of the disease at the pulmonary level. During chemotherapeutic treatment, he said hospital admission twice by Anasarca. A month after completing the treatment (October 2015), it presents worsening of respiratory function and increased the number of violet injuries in members. In the control thorax TC, the progression of the disease at the pulmonary level, secondary to Kaposi sarcoma, as well as at the cutaneous level, is confirmed. The second line of treatment with Paclitaxel (100mg/m2 bicemanal) is proposed by resetting tar (Darunavir/Ritonavir is suspended and tanofovir/emricitabine and raltegravir is maintained). After the first two cycles, it begins with clinical improvement. He has currently received 6 cycles with good tolerance and evolution."
"It is a 55 -year -old male, without a history of interest and worker of the field (area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe albufera), which went to the emergency department for an asthenia picture, very intense myalgias, pharyngitis and fever of up to 39th C of 5 days of evolution. He also had parstestia in hands, feet and lips, along with dysphonia and important dysphagia to solids and liquids for which he had 48h of absolute fasting. For 2 days, I observed that urine was dark and referred to a clear decrease in diuresis. The physical examination was anodine, except for a hyperemic pharynx.
An analytical was requested, in which it stood out: acute renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia at the expense of the direct, discreet elevation of GOT, GPT and CK, marked elevation of the PCR and the VSG, and a very severe platelet. Urine was clearly colurer and highlighted an intense bacteriuria.
An ultrasound was requested, which only described homogeneous 14 cm. In the pretransfusional study, a positive coombs was observed with a cold antibody canoglutinine (without hemolytic anemia).
At that time and given the suspicion of infectious syndrome with multiorgan dysfunction, the family is questioned, which tell us that the patient usually works with organophosphate (chlorpirif√≥s) with little protection and that in the previous days presented a marked connection injection.
The suspicion of Weil syndrome becomes strength, requesting a serology that was positive for Leptospira (IGM +, IgG -) and a determination of leptospira dna in urine (positive) and in blood (negative), explained this fact probably because the septicemic phase (leptospiremic) and the immune phase (leptospir√∫rica) of the same of the same.
While the secondary manifestations to leptospiremia are resolved, the parstesthesia progressively give way to total flaccid paralysis with the rustflexia and progression of the bulbar clinic, a dyspnea that requires intubation and mechanical ventilation in ICU is added to maintain proper ventilation.
Given the possibility of being before a Guillain-Barr√© syndrome secondary to the infection, an EMG is requested, with neurophysiological data compatible with the diagnosis of polyneuropathy/ polyradiculoneuropathy acute sensitive-motora without signs of demyelination. At this point the option of being faced with a polyneuropathy associated with exposure to organophosphorus (chlorpirif√≥s), described in literature, is raised. Colinesterase levels were normal, discarding that option. A few days later, the platelet was recovered and a lumbar puncture compatible with Guillain-Barr√© (albumin-cytological dissociation) was performed.
At this time the literature is reviewed, finding that the syndromic diagnosis of Guillain-Barr√© does not necessarily imply demyelinization, but that its most common variant asks for (acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy) is what is classically known as Guillain-Barr√©, however, there are less common variants where the damage is axonal and non-demyelinating And it has a worse prognosis, as with AMAN (acute motor axonal neuropathy) and AMSAN (acute sensitive-motor axonal neuropathy), the latter being the subtype of our patient. The evolution was good and currently the patient has resumed his day to day prior to the disease."
"18 -year -old male, who consults for intermittent fever maintained for a month of up to 39oc, accompanied by abdominal disagree, joint and asthenia pain; As the only antecedent, fever of unknown origin stands out at age 8, which required admission for 2 months without response to antibiotics. The exploration stood out: right and left axillary adenopathy 1-1.5 cm not stony or painful or adhered, without other findings.
The following differential diagnosis was made:
- Infectious: viral infection (VEB, CVM, VHS, HIV, VHC, VHB, VHA), Auspic infections:
Coxiella serology, Borrelia, Brucella, Lues, (fever Q, Lyme disease).
- Hypothyroidism.
- Autoimmune: les, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis.
- Autoinflamatory syndrome (family Mediterranean fever, traps ...),
- Neoplastic: lymphoma.
- Intestinal juggling syndrome: Celiacy."
"52 -year -old male, a farmer by profession, who enters cellulite and general discomfort. As a history, it presented: arterial hypertension, chronic renal failure, dyslipemia.
The patient consults because approximately 4 days before, while cleaning a dry ditch he notices a bite on the back of the right thigh without being able to identify the insect. At 24 hours it has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 2-3 cm pale of well-defined edges so they prescribed intramuscular methylprednisolone, at 48 hours an erythematous and painful area appears around that lesion. On the third day he presented greater erythema and pain with a distmermal sensation, so amoxicillin and clavulanic is prescribed without improvement so he consults in the emergency service. In ultrasound of this marked muscle thickening with an increased increase in subcutaneous fat and image of cobblestone in surface planes. In the hemogram highlighted 8700 leukocytes (81.5% neutrophils), HB15.7 mg/dl and 120,000 platelets. In the biochemistry, PCR 24 mg/l, creatinine 37/1.4 mg/dl. Given the torpid evolution of the injury, the patient entered surgery and treatment with tazobactam picnacillin was established. At 48 hours they consult the internal medicine service due to poor evolution of the injury. To the exploration erythematous, hot and painful lesion in the posterior and internal face of right thigh that extended from popliteal hollow to gluteal fold and root of the right lower limb, with a white and depressed central central lesion of about 2x3 cm.
After making a differential diagnosis with compatible lesions, it was concluded that it could be a cutaneous loxocellism confirming with the evolution of the lesion. Loxocellism is the poisoning produced by brown spiders inmates (Loxosceles spp.) That are species of arachnids that can cause necrotic arachnoidism. They cause pictures that are associated with pain, erythema and edema located, followed by the development of necrosis. However, the specific mechanisms by which Loxoscela poison exercises these harmful symptoms are little known. In the Mediterranean area, the species rufescens is the most common and generally are usually found in dark places and cause only skin.
The evolution of our patient's injuries supported this diagnosis since a few days later, despite the fact that perilesional cellulite had improved with antibiotic therapy, a gallbladder appeared, which later transformed into a black escale that ulcer√≥, evolution that corresponds to the typical evolution of the lesions due to loxoces. In addition, complementary explorations (serologies, autoimmunity, blood culture and fluid culture of noise) were negative for other entities.
A review of the treatment and handling of this condition was carried out, which focused on local measures such as wound cleaning, local cold, high position of the affection, analgesia, antithetic and antibiotic prophylaxis if it is suspected of overinfection. In addition to the treatment for the prevention of necrosis where there is no clear evidence that attitude would be advisable to follow (dappsone, tetracyclines, antihistamines or hyperbaric oxygen) In our case, local measures and antibiotrapy were used due to overinfection suspicion as well as dapsone (50 mg / 12 hours as an initial dose followed by 100 mg / 12 hours for 10 days for 10 days). The patient specified in priests every 48 hours in an outpatient manner by nursing for 1 month and a half approximate with progressive improvement of the lesion."
"44-year-old male, a native of Morocco, smoker 1-2 CIG/day. Work in gardening. Not other personal or family history of interest. The patient is valued in external internal medicine consultations for a 2 -week box of evolution consisting of the presence of nodular facial lesions, violet erythematics.
The patient is diagnosed with late HIV infection (CD4 60 UL, HIV 317000 copies).
The same biopsy is performed, being the nonspecific result. It is raised as a differential diagnosis sarcoma of kaposi vs bacillary angiomatosis.
Doxycycline is guided 100 md/12 h vo with disappearance of skin lesions a few days later.
Treatment with EGV /Cobicistat, FTC, ABC (Stribild¬Æ) begins.
After 10 days of treatment, the patient goes to the emergency department for acute general discomfort, high fever, oligoanuria and hypotension. In the analytics, progressive increase in leukocytes and procalcitonin, being normal the urine system and thorax radiography. Enter UVI with the diagnosis of sepsis without obvious focus. PCR is received in positive skin lesion biopsy for Bartonella Henselae.
We consider the diagnosis of trenches fever exacerbated by immune reconstitution painting induced by the Targa.
IV gentamycin and corticosteroids are added to high doses. It evolves favorably being discharged and continues its monitoring in infectious consultations.
Immune reconstitution syndrome must be suspected in patients with HIV infection that, after the start of the TAR, develop ""paradoxical"" reactivation pictures of previously controlled opportunistic infections with treatment.
The usual pathogens with which it is described are M. tuberculosis, MAI, CMV, cryptococcus, pneumocystis and herpes virus 8, but there are more rare cases associated with Bartonella as ours."
"53 -year -old male who enters by sepsis box without clear focus.
The patient presented as a personal history chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis to 8 -year ulcera of evolution due to neuropathy of the left sciatic nerve at the middle third of the thigh from the wound of toro asta in 1993 remaining as a sequel equine foot. Followed by traumatology during these years the patient has presented multiple income due to worsening of heel in heel as well as multiple microbiological insulators of multirent microorganisms requireing intravenous antibiotic therapy and multiple surgical debridements.
During a trip to Brazil the patient entered through an acute coronary syndrome with conventional stent placement in anterior descending artery and during this income he presented septic shock chart of probable respiratory origin, which required admission to intensive care unit and orotracheal intubation. After several months of hospital admission, the patient returns to Spain where he enters through a compatible table with sepsis without clear focus. In the complementary explorations, a pulmonary condensation is appreciated on the right base and in the physical examination presented dispersed roncus, edema and erythema in anterior area with ulcera already known that was closing for the second intention. Fluid therapy and empirical antibiotrapy began with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin with improvement of the TA and diuresis figures. During its entry, ankle RM is requested where the presence of abcesses and bone infarctions with great progression of inflammatory activity with respect to prior exploration of November 2015 is objective, isolating itself in ulcer culture of said staphilococus aureus aureus meticilin resistant heel. A few days after admission, the patient begins pain at the back-lumbar level that prevents rest and new febrile peaks, physical examination presented pain to percussion on the spinous process at the level of D11 so that dorsal column radiography with loss of vertebral height of SOMA of D11 is requested with vertebral minting marking. Treatment with vancomycin and rifampicine begins. Therefore, thoracic tac and column RM is requested, which shows spondilodiscitis D10-11 in evolving possibly secondary to hematogenous dissemination secondary to the focus of osteomyelitis despite correct antibiotic therapy, the patient has new febrile peaks and local worsening in the left ankle, so the case is discussed. Ankle osteomyelitis as well as the presence of complications the realization of amputation that is carried out successfully and the continuity of antibiotic treatment, with progressive improvement of pain at the dorsal level, defervescence and decrease in acute phase reactants."

"71 -year -old woman as the only personal history of piohydronephrosis in 1985 with the need for external drainage. He goes to the emergency room per table of 2 months of asthenia evolution, weight loss of 10 kg in 6 months and night sweating. To the exploration, regular general state, sweaty, tachycardic at 120 bpm, normal tension, SAT.O2 94% and temperature 37.8oc, percussion pain in right renal grave, rest without alterations.
In the Emergency Department presents leukocytosis with neutrophilia, normocromic normocytic anemia (HB 10.2 mg/dl) and elevation of acute phase reactants. Urine compatible with infection (important leukocyturia with bacteriuria). On the chest radiography there is a mediastinal widening with tracheal displacement to the left. Hemocultive and urine culture are extracted initiating empirical antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic, enters internal medicine due to urinary tract infection and constitutional syndrome under study, possible lymphoma with symptoms B.
In plant, clinical and analytical improvement of infectious data with isolation of proteus mirabillis in urine culture, sensitive to ciprofloxacin. In clinical ultrasound, mass is displayed that does not identify the right renal silhouette. It is requested tacoabdominal tac objectifying calcified endotoracic goiter and in the abdomen there is a complete destructuring and replacement of the right kidney by a conglomerate of confluent cystic lesions, with pollobulated stern morphology of 11x12x13 cm also affecting the right ureter; bilateral renal lithiasis, some coraliform; as the first possibility xantagranulomatous pyelonephritis.
Xantogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare variant of chronic pyelonephritis that is usually due to infected lithiasis being the most frequent microorganisms E. coli and proteus mirabilis. It usually occurs in middle -aged women with recurrent urinary infection; Symptoms include fever, asthenia, anorexia and weight loss. Analytically appears high anemia and vsg, urine with infection data and positive uroculture for enterobacteria. The choice image test is the TC and the definitive diagnosis is anatomopathological observing groups of xantomatous cells and cells with pseudoglandular pattern that are the degenerate renal tubules, it is important to differentiate it from the renal carcinoma of clear cells. The treatment of choice is nephrectomy together with pre and post-surgical antibiotrapy."
"33 -year -old woman diagnosed in February 2015 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia BII negative ph -phrase due to febrile syndrome and purple lesions in lower limbs. The analytics showed 21000 leukocytes (35% lymphoid appearance), 11.9 g/dl hemoglobin and 22000 platelets. The patient received chemotherapeutic treatment with prefase, induction, and early and late consolidation. Despite this, he presented an early molecular relapse and subsequent morphological relapse, so rescue treatment was performed to induce a complete remission for an AloTPh. During the neutropenia period the patient received antibiotic, antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis with levoxacin 500mg/day VO, cephrryxone 1g/24h EV, fluconazole 400mg/day VO, inhaled pentamidine 300mcg c/28 days and acyclovir 400mg c/8h vo.
Twenty days after the rescue treatment the patient presented fever without apparent focus. In the analytics, pancithopenia with 200 leukocytes (100 neutrophils), 10.7 g/dl hemoglobin and 25000 platelets were evidenced.

"Personal history
DMNIR, psoriasis treated with corticosteroids and metretrexate, episode of lithian -lithotic -right obstructive uropopathy complicated with renal abscess by candida albicans and pseudomone MR with fungia, after rt 8 months before (Funduscopy, transtortic and urocultive negative uroculture echocardiography).

Current disease
71 -year -old male who entered for 4 -day fever of evolution, cough and intense dorsolumbar pain.
After 48 hours he presented pain and coldness in Mid.

Exploration
Febril, regular general condition. TA: 90/60mmhg. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic, without blows, roncus.
Dorsal palpation pain. Mid: distal coldness, fixed cyanosis in lateral compartment, paleness and warm stiffness
Pulses mmii only palpables the femoral der and pedio left.

Complementary tests
He stood out: high acute phase reactants and pre -renal renal failure (Normal Rx thorax and ECG).
- 1st: What existed after that acute ischemia?
Etiologically, it could be due to: arterial embolism (FA, myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction, endocarditis, valvular disease or prostheses, mixoma, aneurysm, atherosclerotic plaque or paradoxical embolia), arterial thrombosis (graft, atherosclerosis, aneurysmatic thrombosis, trapping syndrome, trapping syndrome, trapping syndrome, trapping syndrome, trapping syndrome, trapping syndrome hypercoagulability or low flow) or direct dissection or trauma.
In transtoracic ultrasound, an image compatible with aortic endocarditis was visualized. At the same time, microbiology isolated in blood cultures candida albicans fluconazole-resistant. Non -retinal embolization. TACACO-ABDOMINAL: Spondilodiscitis D7-D8.
- 2nd: endocarditis on native aortic valve by candida albicans resistant to azoles,
criteria? treatment?
According to modified Duke criteria, it was a definitive infectious endocarditis (1 major clinical criteria and 4 minors).
An equinondine or amphotericin b +/- flucitosin at high doses is recommended. After initial IV treatment, reduce to an oral azol at least 6 weeks after surgery, except in fluconazole resistance, which advise voriconazole or postaconazole if it is sensitive. And if not possible resection, prolong treatment.
Our case was treated with caspofungin, valvular resection and supracond√≠lea amputation. - 3: Did you present an endocarditis in 1st income?
He certainly did not present criteria and was reasonably ruled out. But the recurrence of fungary without new urological complications suggest that some focus persisted in time and endocarditis would be the first candidate.

Final diagnosis
¬∑ Endocarditis on native aortic valve by Candida albicans resistant to azoles.
¬∑ Acute ischemia Grade III in MID and spondilodiscitis D7-D8, probably secondary to septic plumes."
"50 -year -old woman appealized and with hypercholesterolemia, without other history of interest, in close contact with dogs and cats at home. He entered in March 2019 by intense cough without expectoration, fever and costal pain of mechanical characteristics of 1 week of evolution. Physical examination and thorax radiography were bland; In the analytics it called Eosinophilia attention> 50% with a total count of 14,000/Œºl and IGE> 5000 kua/l (0-120). Immunophenotype and peripheral blood morphology was performed that ruled out malignancy. After a batch of antibiotics, it was decided high and control in consultations after disappearance of fever and partial improvement of cough, with persistence of costal pain that was attributed to cough.
The study with serologies was expanded, being all negative except toxocara canis IgG positive and tac was carried out with finding of multi -bilateral pulmonary opacities millimeter, some with halo in tangled glass suggestive suggestive atypical process probably parasitic.
Before this painting of Eosinophilia, respiratory clinic, epidemiology, serology and compatible image tests was diagnosed with infestation by toxocara canis. Ophthalmology assessment was requested that ruled out ocular toxocariasis and specific treatment was initiated with 400mg albendazol every 12h for 5 days and 30mg of prednisone for 5 days.
A month after the end of the treatment, the residual cough disappeared, in addition to reducing eosinophilia values ‚Äã‚Äãin half and IgE in peripheral blood. With this, the deworming of domestic animals was recommended.
Toxocariasis is a rare infection in our environment, it is given by the intake of eggs of the toxocara canis or toxocara cati nematode that usually infect dogs and cats."
"We present a 26-year-old male who enters the Internal Medicine Service due to fever and skin-military lesions accompanied by whitish urethral secretion and dysuria from three days before admission. As an epidemiological history of interest, I referred unprotected relationships with several heterosexual contacts in the last month.
On physical examination was feverish (39.5o), Normotense, well perfused, eupneic and without sepsis data. It had submaxillary and axillary adenopathies millimeter, films and non -painful; Affectation of the oral mucosa with necrotic lip peel, petechiae in palate, whitish exudate and important pain; Asymptomatic macular peri -buttal lesions in both hands, feet and at the scrotal and urethral level without visible secretions. In addition, it associated dry cough with crackles on the right base.
The complementary tests showed a monocytosis with left deviation, elevation of acute phase reactants (PCR 17.3, vsg 50, PCT 0.19) and an interstitial infiltrate in the lower lower lobe. The serological results ruled out HIV, CMV, VEB, Syphilis and Hepatitis B and C. The blood cultures were negative while the crops of the oral cavity and urethral exudate demonstrated infection by VHS-1 and Chlamydia Trachomatis respectively. Dermatology assessment confirmed major multiform erythema with an affectation of the oral mucosa and reactive acras areas to the infectious process.
The patient presented a rapid clinical, analytical and radiological improvement, with complete resolution of the lesions when receiving symptomatic treatment and empirical antibiotrapy with ceftriaxone, doxycycline and acyclovir 10 days and a dose of azithromycin. A month of monitoring control serologies were negative and complete exploration was rigorously normal."
